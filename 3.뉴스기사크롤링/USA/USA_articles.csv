USA,CNN,Sophie Tanno,World,,,2024-07-13,11:13,Israel targets Hamas military chief in strike Palestinian officials say killed at least 70 people,"Israel says it targeted Hamas’ military chief and an alleged mastermind of the October 7 attacks in an airstrike in southern Gaza which local authorities said killed at least 71 Palestinians. Mohammed Deif – the leader of Qassam Brigades, Hamas’ military wing – was targeted Saturday in Al-Mawasi, a displacement camp west of the city of Khan Younis, an Israeli security official told CNN. The Israeli military said it in the process of verifying whether Deif was killed in the strike, who was targeted alongside the head of the Khan Younis brigade, Rafe Salama. The strike left scenes of devastation in the area, where the Gaza Health Ministry reported at least 71 people killed and nearly 300 people injured. The strikes hit an area where displaced people were sheltering, according to the ministry. Videos from the scene show locals and rescue teams trying to unearth several people still trapped. Al-Mawasi has been designated by Israel as a safe zone for Palestinians fleeing the fighting raging in Gaza. The Kuwait and Nasser Hospitals on the ground are now struggling to cope with the high numbers of dead and injured civilians coming in, the ministry said. Al-Mawasi residents described the terrifying moment the strike hit. “I was sitting in the bathroom, and before I heard explosions from the strike, the bathroom flew off,” a young boy called Hammoud told a CNN stringer on the ground. “Then, the whole area became filled with smoke, and then the shells began to fall.” Hammoud’s young brother was killed in the strike whilst his sister is currently in hospital receiving treatment for her injuries, his family told CNN. Hamas denied Israeli claims it had targeted Deif and Salama, calling the killings a “horrific massacre.” “The occupation’s claims of targeting leaders are false claims, and this is not the first time the occupation has claimed to target Palestinian leaders, only for its lies to be exposed later,” a statement read. Israeli security and intelligence first received intelligence about a potential opportunity to strike Hamas’s top military commander in recent days, but a clear window of opportunity to strike Deif only crystallized in the last 24 hours, an Israeli official said. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, Israeli military chief of staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi and top Shin Bet officials held multiple discussions overnight to assess the viability of a strike before the green light was given, the official said. A key focus of the discussions was assessing Israeli intelligence indicating that there were no hostages in the area, the official added, as well as the effect that carrying out such a significant strike might have on ongoing ceasefire and hostage deal negotiations. Little is known about Deif. Thought to have been born in the 1960s, Deif is a bomb maker was behind a wave of four suicide attacks in 1996 that killed 65 people in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv and other outrages intended to derail the peace process. His full name is Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri, but he became known as El Deif (the Guest), because, for decades, he stayed in different houses every night to avoid being tracked, and killed, by Israel. Deif has been the target of Israeli assassination attempts before. A 2014 Israel strike killed his wife, seven-month-old son and three-year-old daughter. In May, the International Criminal Court said it was seeking arrest warrants for Deif and other senior Hamas figures, saying they had “reasonable grounds” to believe they bore responsibility for the October 7 attacks, which saw around 1,200 Israelis killed. This is a developing story and will be updated.",20,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/13/middleeast/khan-younis-strike-gaza-intl/index.html
USA,CNN,Rene Marsh,Politics,,,2024-07-13,08:50,Black voters helped Biden win Georgia in 2020. Some say it’s too risky to abandon him now,"Alanna Morris tuned in to last month’s presidential debate hoping to watch President Joe Biden “wipe the floor” with former President Donald Trump. Instead, the 44-year-old Atlanta cardiologist saw a candidate she hardly recognized. She turned the event off halfway through, feeling sad and concerned the president had suffered a medical event like a stroke. That disappointment, however, hasn’t dissuaded her from her plan to vote for the president. She finds the alternative – a second Trump term – untenable. “Don’t rock the boat unless you have a plan to get me back to shore,” she said. “Getting me to shore is making sure that Donald Trump is not in office come January 2025.” Four years ago, Black voters saved Biden’s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination after his poor finishes in predominantly White early voting states. Now, that support within the Black community – from battleground state voters and Black leaders – serves as one of the last bulwarks against a growing number of lawmakers and donors asking him to pass the torch. That support is seen in Georgia, which was crucial to the president’s past political success. Biden became the first Democrat to win Georgia since 1992, when he defeated Trump by less than 12,000 votes. But repeating that victory will be a challenge. In a new memo to Democrats this week, the Biden campaign argued that its “clearest path” to winning in November runs through the so-called Blue Wall states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, suggesting that Georgia – as well as other battlegrounds like Nevada, Arizona and North Carolina – aren’t as competitive. Any path to victory for Biden in the Peach State this year will depend on the continued support of Black voters, many of whom said they would prefer to keep him, even over the opportunity to nominate Vice President Kamala Harris as the party’s first Black woman nominee. In interviews, the president’s supporters in the state shared a similar message: the stakes of this election are too high to change course now. “I am voting for democracy, and as of right now a convicted felon is not it,” Jarita Burdette, a 42-year-old Atlanta resident, told CNN. “Biden’s our guy, that’s who I’m riding with.” Some voters said they thought Biden was capable of leading for another four years and preferred him over a hypothetical alternative. Many expressed frustration with the attention being paid to Biden’s age and performance vs. Trump’s record and policies. “The Democratic Party knew four years ago how old Joe Biden would be in 2024,” said Michelle Mitchell, a 69-year-old Black Atlanta resident who participated in a CNN roundtable with older voters and opposes efforts to pressure Biden to step aside. “To try to pull a stunt like this at the 11th hour is very disappointing.” Jayla Koriyan, a 26-year-old Atlanta voter, said her vote in November is aimed at keeping Trump out of office. She pointed to the former president’s plans to launch a massive deportation operation of migrants and criticized him for his unwillingness over the years to denounce the far-right Proud Boys or the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. Asked if she had concerns about Biden’s age, Koriyan replied: “What are our other options?” Multiple post-debate polls have shown that Black voters are split on whether the president should step aside or remain at the top of the Democratic ticket. A Washington Post/ABC News/Ipsos poll released this week found 47% of Black voters said Biden should continue his campaign, compared to 49% who said he should cede the nomination to someone else. A New York Times/Siena College poll found a similar split. But the same polls suggest that the calls for Biden to cede the nomination aren’t as strong within the Black community. A recent Pew Research Center survey found that among Biden supporters, 58% of Black supporters said both Biden and Trump ought to be replaced, compared with 84% of Asian supporters, 74% of White supporters and 67% of Hispanic supporters. Support among Black voters has long been the make or break point for Democratic politicians. In 2008, Black voters helped Barack Obama win the Democratic nomination and their high voter turnout helped him carry states like Ohio and North Carolina. In 2016, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton won the Democratic nomination thanks in large part to Black primary voters in South Carolina and other southern states. And in 2020, Biden seemed poised for primary defeat after he placed fourth in Iowa and fifth in New Hampshire. It was his first place finish in South Carolina, fresh off the endorsement of Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn, that turned the primary around. Biden won 61% of the Black vote, which made up 56% of the Democratic primary electorate, according to CNN exit polling. As of Friday, more than a dozen members of Congress have called on Biden to pass the torch to a new generation. But the president’s support among the Congressional Black Caucus has remained strong publicly. Clyburn said Friday that he’s “all in” on Biden, and that discussions about whether the president should drop out should end. “The conversation should focus on the record of this administration, on the alternative to his election, and let Joe Biden make his own decisions about his political future,” Clyburn told NBC’s “The Today Show.” “He’s earned that right.” Rhonda Briggins, a 51-year-old political organizer based in Atlanta, said her main focus is defeating Trump and boosting down ballot Democratic candidates. Everything else, including calls for Biden to step aside, is a distraction. But part of her reasoning for keeping Biden is borne out of a fear for Harris and her safety. Briggins said Harris is “more than qualified” to become president, but the thought of the vice president becoming the nominee made her nervous. “Sexism in America is more prevalent than even racism in America, and so to be a Black woman you get both hits,” she said. “I’m afraid of so many things when we even think about that as an option for her.” Among the names floated in the media to replace Biden if he steps aside – California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer among them – the most logical choice for many Biden skeptics has been Harris, who could inherit much of the campaign’s funding and infrastructure and run on his record. Morris said that Harris would be an “obvious choice,” and she would vote for her if she were the nominee. Her concern, she said, was that independents wouldn’t. “We saw this with Stacey Abrams here in the state of Georgia, where you had a highly competent nominee who had all the credentials,” Morris said, referring to the Democratic gubernatorial nominee in both 2018 and 2022. “She had everything. She was the full package. And she did not win.” Some voters said they would be open to Harris and think she can do the job. But a few said they hadn’t seen enough of her over the last four years to feel confident swapping her in. Robyn Gipson, a 29-year-old Atlanta voter who wants Biden to stay in, said she didn’t have confidence Harris could beat Trump because she hasn’t heard enough from her over the last few years. “I feel as though Kamala, the only thing I know her for is ‘We did it Joe,’” Gipson said, referencing the viral moment when Harris called Biden to congratulate him on their 2020 victory. “It’s been four years, we haven’t seen anything.” George Mitchell, a 78-year-old Atlanta resident who also participated in the roundtable discussion, said he would back Harris. Anyone, in his view, would be better than Trump. “I would support my third-grade nephew,” he said. “I will support anyone that the Democrats put up there.”",32,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/13/politics/black-voters-georgia-biden/index.html
USA,CNN,Josh Campbell,Entertainment,2024-07-13,06:52,,,‘Rust’ movie set shooting trial: Why the involuntary manslaughter case against actor Alec Baldwin was dismissed,"Two days after Alec Baldwin’s involuntary manslaughter trial began and nearly three years after the fatal “Rust” movie set shooting that led to the charge against him, a New Mexico judge said eight words that left the actor visibly emotional – and marked the trial’s end. “Your motion to dismiss with prejudice is granted,” Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer told Baldwin and his legal team in court on Friday afternoon, prompting an already shaking Baldwin to remove his glasses and sob into his hand before embracing his wife, Hilaria. The ruling concluded nearly three years of back-and-forth legal arguments and turnover in prosecutors leading up to the trial against Baldwin, who faced up to 18 months in prison and a $5,000 fine related to the October 2021 fatal shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of the Western film, “Rust.” At the time of the shooting on October 21, 2021, Baldwin was practicing a “cross draw” – pulling a gun from a holster on the side of his body opposite from his draw hand – with a prop gun at a church on the film’s New Mexico set when it fired a live round, killing Hutchins and injuring “Rust” director Joel Souza. On Thursday, Baldwin’s defense team filed a motion to dismiss the case stating that the prosecutors concealed evidence “potentially pointing to an external source of the live ammunition (prop supplier Seth Kenney) because the evidence would be favorable to Baldwin,” court documents show. On Friday, following a chaotic hearing that involved one special prosecutor taking the stand as a witness and another special prosecutor – Erlinda Johnson – resigning from the prosecution team that day, Marlowe Sommer sided with the defense as a result of the evidence issue first brought to light Thursday, and granted the motion to dismiss with prejudice, meaning that the case cannot be brought again. Special prosecutor Kari Morrissey, who on Friday answered questions under oath from defense attorney Alex Spiro, said she was disappointed by the dismissal. “I believe that the importance of the evidence was misconstrued by the defense attorneys, but I have to respect the court’s decision,” Morrissey said following court Friday. Here’s what led to the dismissal in the Baldwin case. Marlowe Sommer, who had been adamant about keeping the trial on schedule, was noticeably perturbed early Friday when she halted testimony in the case and dismissed the jury so she could take up Baldwin’s motion to throw out his criminal charge. Ahead of her ruling Friday, the judge referred to a dismissal with prejudice as a “very extreme sanction” that would require her to go through each element of the motion and “make a very good record as to why I’m seeing what I’m seeing,” she said. Baldwin’s team argued that state investigators did not properly share with the defense that a man had delivered a box of ammunition purportedly connected to the case to investigators. In its motion, the defense claimed the state “unilaterally withheld” evidence that could be favorable to Baldwin’s trial, which is a violation of the Brady rule, named after the 1963 Brady v. Maryland case. The rule requires prosecutors “to disclose material, exculpatory information in the government’s possession to the defense,” according to Cornell Law School. In order to establish a Brady violation, Marlowe Sommer explained Friday, the defendant has to show that “the prosecution suppressed evidence, the evidence was favorable to the accused and the evidence was material to the defense.” RELATED ARTICLE
Live bullet found in prop holster of actor Jensen Ackles on ‘Rust’ set, crime scene technician testifies In court Thursday, crime scene technician Marissa Poppell testified that retired police officer Troy Teske had delivered a box of ammunition to the Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office in March after Gutierrez-Reed’s conviction, CNN previously reported. Teske, who was a friend of the armorer’s father, told investigators he thought the ammunition could be associated with the “Rust” incident, according to Poppell. The items, however, were cataloged separately from Baldwin’s case, excluded from the “Rust” case inventory and not tested to see if they matched the lethal round, according to Poppell’s testimony. Marlowe Sommer said on Friday that the suppression-of-evidence element of proving a Brady element was satisfied. “The Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office and the prosecution failed to disclose the supplemental report to defense and provide defense an opportunity to inspect the rounds collected into evidence that Mr. Teske gave,” the judge said. The second Brady element Marlowe Sommer broke down is whether the evidence suppressed by prosecutors was favorable to Baldwin, “either as impeachment or exculpatory evidence,” she said. “This prong is satisfied. The suppressed evidence is favorable to the accused,” the judge said. “It is impeachment evidence, has even been offered in this trial as impeachment evidence and is potentially exculpatory to the defense.” Marlowe Sommer added that the evidence’s exculpatory value couldn’t be analyzed at such a late point in time due to the non-disclosure. She next examined whether the suppressed evidence was material to the case, which she concluded it was. “The late discovery of this evidence during trial has impeded the effective use of evidence in such a way that it has impacted the fundamental fairness of the proceedings,” Marlowe Sommer said, adding that Baldwin’s defense wasn’t in a position to test the prosecution’s theory regarding the source of the live rounds that killed Hutchins. The judge said the state failed to provide the discovery to Baldwin’s defense team, referring to the prosecutor’s withholding of the information as “intentional and deliberate.” Marlowe Sommer said: “If this conduct does not rise to the level of bad faith, it certainly comes so near to bad faith as to show signs of scorching.” RELATED ARTICLE
Judge dismisses charges against Alec Baldwin after defense alleges government misconduct The judge also agreed that the late evidence was “highly prejudicial” to Baldwin’s case. “The jury has been sworn, jeopardy has attached, and this disclosure during the course of trial is so late that it undermines the defendant’s preparation for trial,” Marlowe Sommer said. “There is no way for the court to right this wrong.” The judge added just before granting the motion to dismiss the case: “The state’s discovery violation has injected a needless, incurable delay into the jury trial. Dismissal with prejudice is warranted to ensure the integrity of the judicial system and the efficient administration of justice.” Gutierrez-Reed’s attorney, Jason Bowles, said he will move to dismiss her case following Baldwin’s case dismissal. “The judge found intentional misconduct and we also have had the same failures in Hannah’s case, by the State,” Bowles said.

USA,CNN,Chris Isidore,Business,2024-07-13,10:00,,,"Postage is going up again. You should care, even if you don’t send mail","On Sunday, the cost of a stamp is going up for the second time this year, jumping 5 cents for first class postage to 73 cents. You probably didn’t notice. And truthfully, you may not care. But you should. Most people don’t use mail the way they used to – if they send out mail at all. But the price of postage is a big deal to millions of businesses and organizations that spend most of the $40.8 billion a year spent on mail, including letters, bulk mailings, junk mail and periodicals. And higher prices are making them cut back – and hurting the budget of the US Postal Service and, potentially, its ability to continue its crucial services. That includes everything from delivering online purchases to life-saving prescription drugs. And this year, tens of millions of voters will cast their ballots in the presidential election by mail. And, most of all, businesses still depend on the mail to help them reach customers and keep the economy going. Postage increases used to be pegged to inflation, usually going up at most once a year. But Sunday will mark the sixth increase in three years, during which first-class stamp increases rose 10 percentage points faster than overall inflation. Major mailers say hiking prices that quickly will drive them away from the post office, eventually drying up the agency’s budget. “We think they’ve overshot the mark on raising their rates,” said Michael Plunkett, CEO of the Association for Postal Commerce, which represents companies in the mailing and shipping industry. “These rate increases aren’t generating much additional revenue because it’s driving volume out of the system that is likely never to return.” The price of a first-class stamp reached 10 cents in 1974, just before the 200th anniversary of the service. As recently as 2002 it stood at 34 cents, or half of today’s price ahead of Sunday’s increase. So if raising the prices of stamps could ultimately endanger the postal service, why does the USPS keep hiking the costs to mail a letter? The short answer is because the agency needs money – badly. The long answer is more complicated. The postal service and the United States have grown side by side since before the country’s birth – quite literally. Founding Father Benjamin Franklin was appointed the first postmaster general in 1775, the USPS notes on its website. The service expanded to keep pace with the new nation, and to help bind the young country together. It was a major reason roads were constructed between its early cities. US 1, the first federal highway, started out as Boston Post Road to carry mail between New York and Boston, and still goes by that name in many locations. “When Alexis de Tocqueville toured the young country, in 1831, the United States boasted twice as many post offices as Britain and five times as many as France,” Smithsonian Magazine noted in October 2020. Today it has 640,000 employees located in over 30,000 facilities nationwide. Postage stamps, though, took quite awhile longer to make an appearance. “Alexander M. Greig’s City Despatch Post, a private New York City carrier, issued the first adhesive stamps in the United States on February 1, 1842,” according to the Postal Service. Congress then authorized postage stamps in 1847, and prepayment of postage was required in 1855. The iconic Pony Express – a feature in many a Western film and novel – came about five years later, in 1860. And the postal service has made other appearances in pop culture and American history. The climax of beloved holiday movie “Miracle on 34th Street” has (spoiler alert) the Post Office rescuing Santa Claus on Christmas Eve. The characters of Cliff on the 1980s sitcom “Cheers” and Newman in the 1990s sitcom “Seinfeld,” were letter carriers. The band The Postal Service was an indie-pop darling near the turn of the century. And the 1985 novel (by David Brin) and 1997 movie (starring Kevin Costner) “The Postman” take the importance of delivering mail into a dystopian, sci-fi future. But mail deliveries shriveled with the introduction of new ways to communicate and connect. Families and friends can communicate by email, text or apps. Bills can get paid electronically. Physical mail doesn’t play the same role in American life that it used to. For many, the individual letter is as relevant today as VHS movies, floppy computer discs and cassette tapes. This century’s nickname for the traditional letter - snail mail - is hardly a compliment. In its most recent year, the service delivered 11.4 billion individual letters. That may sound like a lot, but it’s down 75% from 20 years ago. While stamp prices have doubled in that time, most experts point the finger at technology instead. “For most households, mail is not a significant expenditure,” Plunkett said. “If the price of a stamp was a dollar I would send the same number of Christmas cards out later this year as I did last year.” In contrast, online shopping has lifted package deliveries significantly. But the Postal Service doesn’t have the lock on that business that it does in its mail service, said Kevin Kosar, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. “Before the digital age hit, the Postal Service had a very valuable monopoly. Those days are gone,” he said. “The package business is going up, but that’s not a monopoly business for them. It’s very competitive.” But Plunkett and other critics worry that the growth in the competitive package business will not produce the profits needed to make up for the declining mail volumes. The major mailers were never going to like the idea of paying more for postage. But they argue, with considerable evidence to back them up, that raising rates as rapidly as they have been climbing, is driving away business the service needs and worsening its economic condition. “By jacking the rates up, its efficiency and productivity go way down,” said Art Sackler, executive director of the Coalition for a 21st Century Postal Service, another trade group representing business that use the service. “Last year, by its own measure, its efficiency dropped by the most in 60 years.” Critics are concerned about the rate increases: The worsening finances and efficiency could eventually force the Postal Service to run out of money, perhaps within a few years, and either start depending on direct taxpayer subsidies from Congress that it doesn’t currently receive or cut back on staffing and service. The Postal Service under current Postmaster General Louis DeJoy laid out a 10-year plan in 2021 to modernize the service and stem ongoing losses. Before, he told the Senate in April, the USPS had been in “financial death spiral” for years, but that under the $40 billion modernization plan, “we are making the changes necessary to ensure that we are around to serve the country well into the future.” But the plan, which includes restructuring its network of mail handling facilities, using more full-time staff, improving transportation and delivery methods and investing in technology, has not lived up to early promises. The service had projected it would break even by its last fiscal year and post a $1.7 billion annual profit in the current fiscal year. Instead, it lost $6 billion last year and is forecast to lose another $6 billion or more in the current fiscal year, according to congressional testimony in April from Michael Kubayanda, chairman of the rate-setting Postal Regulatory Commission. And some of the unions that represent postal workers are concerned the modernization plan will try to improve finances by reducing the reliability of the service. “The cost of a letter is still a heck of deal,” said Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union. “I think there’s good and I think there’s bad in the plan. I think we do have to adapt to the world of growing package business and declining mail volumes. Our concern with the 10-year plan is anything that slows down service.” Kubayanda testified in April that he doubts the modernization plan will be able to achieve its financial and service goals. “It looks increasingly difficult to have a universal postal system that reaches every American six days a week, at affordable prices, with reasonably fast and reliable service, and is self-sustaining financially,” he said.",31,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/13/business/postage-rate-increase/index.html?utm_source=business_ribbon
USA,CNN,Chris Isidore,Business,2024-07-13,06:00,,,How Boeing defrauded the United States and escaped with a ‘slap on the wrist’,"Boeing faces up to $487 million in fines as part of its anticipated guilty plea to a felony charge related to two fatal crashes of the 737 Max. Critics of the deal, however, are calling it a “slap on the wrist.” While corporate guilty pleas by companies the size of Boeing are rare, and there are some terms of the plea agreement that Boeing leadership undoubtedly found onerous, the deal does show the limits of corporate criminal charges. Boeing agreed to plead guilty to a charge that it defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration, hiding crucial information about a design flaw on the 737 Max during its original certification process. That design flaw has been tied to crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people, plunging the company into a crisis that led to $32 billion in losses. “The Justice Department does no one any favors by trying to sell this as a tough deal,” said Peter Goeltz, a former managing director of the National Transportation Safety Board and now a CNN contributor who consults for transportation companies. “It doesn’t smell like a tough deal.” Under the plea settlement reached late Sunday, a $243 million fine that Boeing agreed to pay back in 2021 could be doubled to $487 million. “That’s what, the price of three 777’s?” Goeltz said. “I’m not sure that it’s a significant fine.” There are some other numbers backing Goeltz up. Before the losses started in 2019, the company was reporting record annual revenue of $101 billion and record core operating profit of $10.7 billion, or 21 times the cost of of the $487 million fine. While Boeing’s credit rating is now at risk of falling into the junk bond status for the first time, credit rating agency Moody’s came out with a statement Monday that the plea and penalties “will have little effect on Boeing’s finances or operations.” And Boeing nearly escaped even this slap on the wrist. In January a door plug blew off a 737 Max approaching 16,000 feet. While no one was killed or seriously injured on that Alaska Airlines flight, the incident not only brought unwanted attention and a slew of federal investigations, it upended an agreement Boeing reached in January 2021 with the Justice Department to end the risk of prosecution for defrauding the FAA during the Max certification. The Alaska Air incident happened just days before the probationary period would have ended. The expected guilty plea did little to satisfy family members of the crash victims, who branded it a “sweetheart deal,” an “atrocious abomination” and a gross “miscarriage of justice.” Their attorneys had argued that Boeing should have been hit with a maximum fine worth as much as $24.8 billion, which they calculated based on a multiple of their estimate of combined losses sustained by the families. Other corporations that pleaded guilty to felonies have agreed to much larger fines. Oil giant BP agreed to pay $4 billion to settle criminal charges, including manslaughter, related to the explosion and oil spill at its Deepwater Horizon oil platform in 2010 that killed 11 workers. Volkswagen pleaded guilty to three US felony criminal charges and agreed to pay $2.8 billion in criminal penalties in 2017 after it admitted to cheating on its diesel emissions tests. “The fact that this is in the millions of dollars rather than billions is an indication this is a slap on the wrist,” said Paul Cassell, a University of Utah law professor who worked on the BP case on behalf of victims and is now working for the families in the Boeing crashes. One of the facts angering family members is that Boeing agreed to plead guilty to simply defrauding the FAA, rather than facing manslaughter charges for the deaths of hundreds of people. “That’s a tougher case to prove, but I believe the evidence was there,” said Mark Lindquist, another attorney representing family members, as well as some passengers aboard the Alaska Air flight. “As a practical matter, the result might not have been a lot different” if there had been manslaughter rather than fraud charges in this criminal case, Lindquist said. “From a philosophical basis, it would have felt more like accountability and justice for the victims’ families.” But while the Justice Department announced in January of 2021 that “misleading statements, half-truths, and omissions communicated by Boeing employees to the FAA” played a direct role in the crashes, it has taken only limited criminal action against any individual employee, and none against the top executives who oversaw the company’s decisions at that time. The Justice Department said in a press statement early Monday that the agreement included “no immunity to any individual employees, including corporate executives, for any conduct.” But of the two former Boeing employees cited in the original settlement of the case in 2021, only one, Mark Forkner, the chief technical pilot at Boeing at the time, ever faced criminal charges, and he was eventually acquitted after his attorney convinced the jury that he was being made a scapegoat. “As a practical matter, individuals are more sympathetic to jurors than companies,” Lindquist said. “DOJ made a prosecutorial decision to pursue the company rather than individuals.” RELATED ARTICLE
Boeing agrees to plead guilty to defrauding the FAA but escapes punishment sought by victims’ families There are also defenses in an individual’s criminal case that are not possible in a corporate criminal case. “With an individual, there’s always someone else he or she can point the finger at,” said Lindquist. Boeing attorneys had it as part of their mission to make sure that its executives did not face any criminal charges, Lindquist said. “From the beginning, that’s been clear,” he said. A Boeing spokesman said the company had no comment about the anticipated guilty plea or the case beyond a brief statement confirming the agreement. Even if there are no criminal charges brought against executives, they can face significant penalties, Arlen said. That could come in the form of “clawbacks,” in which Boeing demands executives return bonuses they received during the time the misconduct was committed. “Ensuring that the individuals are held accountable is the most important thing,” she said. But so far the Boeing board has shown little indication of wanting to hold executives financially responsible. It recently gave CEO Dave Calhoun a 45% raise, taking his pay from $22.6 million to $32.8 million for 2023. His predecessor, Dennis Muilenburg, lost the CEO job at the end of 2019 without any severance but left the company with a package of stock worth about $80 million at that time. Asked about possible clawbacks, Boeing pointed to company policy, which states in part: “The board shall have the discretion… to recover incentive-based compensation paid to any executive of the company who has engaged in fraud, bribery, or illegal acts… or knowingly failed to report such acts of an employee over whom such officer had direct supervisory responsibility.” But despite that language, no clawbacks have occurred. Arlen said it would also be justified for compensation for board members to be clawed back. While Calhoun was not an executive during this time, he was on the Boeing board, receiving more than $300,000 a year while the certification process for the Max was taking place. “At the end of the day, when you have a company with systemic problems, the ultimate buck stops with the board,” she said. The most serious penalty that Boeing could face is by far the least likely – it could be barred from federal government contracts due to its guilty plea. And that could conceivably force the company out of business: US government contracts accounted for 37% of its revenue in 2023, or about $29 billion, according to company filings. But while it will need to get waivers from the government to continue its contracts, everyone expects those waivers will be granted. RELATED ARTICLE
Boeing was once known for safety and engineering. But critics say an emphasis on profits changed that Most of those contracts are with Boeing’s defense and space business, not its commercial aircraft unit. Asked about the Department of Defense contracts, Pentagon spokesperson Air Force Major General Patrick Ryder told reporters Monday that “DOD will assess the company’s remediation plans and agreement with the Department of Justice to make a determination as to what steps are necessary and appropriate to protect the federal government.” But the US government has few alternatives than sticking with Boeing, despite both the expected guilty plea and the years of quality issues. Beyond the lack of alternatives, few if any decision makers in the federal government want to see Boeing go out of business.

USA,CNN,Jessie Gretener,Paris Olympics 2024,2024-07-13,00:00,,,The Olympics have long promoted safe sex. Now it wants to focus on pleasure.,"The City of Love has a message as it prepares for the Olympics: Performance is not always the priority. Rather, when it comes to sex, pleasure takes first place. As Paris starts welcoming athletes to the Olympic Village in the coming days, organizers of the 2024 Games are set to launch a comprehensive sexual health campaign that champions pleasure and consent as well as the traditional emphasis on safety. It is an important message, backed by research, that is rarely endorsed on a stage with a global spotlight as influential as the Olympics. Prioritizing pleasure in sexual health refers to the approach of celebrating the physical and mental benefits of sexual experiences as well as minimizing the risks. It aims to rewrite fear and shame narratives that cast sex as taboo, with sexual health organizations promoting the sex-positive method as fundamental for unlocking greater agency over sexual rights and well-being.

Sex: Does it actually improve your life? A systematic review by the World Health Organization and advocacy group The Pleasure Project found that pleasure-inclusive sex education is a more effective sexual health intervention strategy than abstinence programs and risk-focused messaging. The findings show that it increases condom usage and enhances knowledge and self-esteem, which are crucial to promoting safer choices in the bedroom. The decision to focus on pleasure-inclusive messaging at the Olympics is especially significant at a time when sex education is increasingly under attack in many countries. In the United States alone, 2024 has seen a surge in restrictive state-level sex education proposals that aim to limit what can be taught in the classroom, such as by removing guidance around contraception or advocating for abstinence. Paris’s focus on pleasure and consent is part of the Olympics’ long-running history of promoting safe sex, with organizers of the 1988 Seoul Games first making headline-grabbing hand-outs of condoms to competitors to raise awareness of HIV and AIDS. Since then, the International Olympic Committee has encouraged host cities to roll out condom initiatives at all summer and winter games, from a record-breaking 450,000 condoms at the 2016 Rio Olympics - equivalent to 42 per athlete - to keeping up the tradition at the 2022 Beijing Olympics despite COVID-19 social distancing rules. This year, organizers in charge of first aid announced that over 200,000 male condoms, 20,000 female condoms, and 10,000 dental dams would be made available at the Paris Olympic Village, which will host around 14,500 athletes. They will also have numerous sexual health testing centers on site for athletes, in addition to the sexual health awareness messaging. While one athlete - a gold medallist - once suggested sex was “part of the Olympic spirit … Why do you think they give away so many condoms?” the massive number of condoms distributed is not just a reflection of the competitors’ extra-athletic activities. Instead, the initiatives are intended to be used as a springboard for sex education. Anne Philpott is the founder of The Pleasure Project, an international organization that has spent the past two decades advocating for pleasure-inclusive sex education. She applauds Paris’ decision to pair its condom initiative with pleasure and consent messaging. “So far the public health world has not done a good job of promoting safe sex,” Philpott said, explaining that promoting condoms “purely for avoiding negative consequences,” is not effective. Rather, she says the most productive way to encourage safe sex is to flip the script from the beginning by focusing on why people have sex. “People think pleasure is a bit frivolous or the icing on the cake. But we now know that if we had integrated pleasure considerations into sexual health interventions from the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, we would have saved considerably more lives,” Philpott explained. Philpott told CNN that the need to shift the narrative in safe sex conversations is as urgent as ever. She says if there is a failure to do so, people could instead shape their opinions from the misinformation and harmful explicit content running rampant online. “There’s been a big rise in choking being seen as a normal part of sexual activity when it’s actually very dangerous,” Philpott gave as an example, as she urged sex education curriculums to catch up with what people are able to access online. The need to learn about one’s sexual desires, needs, and boundaries is a constantly evolving process, with the Olympics’ spotlight on safe sex also highlighting the opportunity for wider sporting communities to become trusted spaces for such conversations. In the coastal town of Kilifi in Kenya, Deogratia Okoko sees the value of expanding sex education beyond the classroom, using soccer to teach young boys about issues such as consent and contraception. The scheme to which he contributes, known as “Moving The Goalposts,” works directly with community leaders, fathers, and young boys to provide resources on sexual health, sexual rights, gender, and positive masculinity. “We found that one of the places that they spend a lot of their time is the football pitch,” Okoko said. “We began to design our sessions based on soccer drills to explain certain issues,” Okoko said, adding: “You’ll find that sometimes they get so engrossed in the debrief discussions that they forget that they were supposed to actually train and play.” Okoko explained that the initiative also provides a safe space for boys to access condoms and HIV testing kits, with societal shame often creating barriers for boys to buy these products directly from the shops. “It’s no longer just let’s play football, let’s practice and go away … these spaces are now a community used by them to talk about issues that they’d not normally talk about,” Okoko said. “One of the things that really came clearly to me was how using this strategy helped in mental health,” Okoko told CNN. “They feel like they can talk about anything, if there’s a challenge that they’re going through, they come to the pitch.” Reflecting on the Paris organizers’ decision to include pleasure and consent in their sexual health messaging, Okoko says it is “imperative” to have high-profile platforms set the example. “It’s fundamental. It’s important. It’s good if we, to the best of our abilities, find great ways of passing that message across,” Okoko said.",26,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/13/europe/paris-olympics-sex-education-pleasure-spt-intl/index.html
