SYDNEY, July 12 (Xinhua) -- A roadshow for the first China Commodity Fair Australia (CCF Australia) was held in Sydney on Friday, attracting around 100 representatives from the Chinese and Australian governments, business sectors as well as media.
The roadshow aimed to fully present the CCF Australia, which will be held for the first time at the International Convention Center Sydney on Sept. 26-28, 2024.
With highlights and preparation progress introduced during the roadshow, it sought to deepen the exchange and trade cooperation between China and Australia in the industry of consumer goods.
""Through this fair, Australian consumers will have the opportunity to access more high-quality Chinese products and have more choices in their lives,"" Liu Dianxun, director general of the Trade Development Bureau of the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, told the roadshow.
At the same time, Chinese companies can have a deep understanding of the needs of the Australian market and find more business opportunities, he said.
""I believe that with the joint efforts of all parties, the cooperation between China and Australia in the field of consumer goods will be taken to a new level and bring more tangible benefits to the people in our two countries,"" Liu said.
Ye Wei, economic and commercial counselor of the Chinese Consulate-General in Sydney, said China has built a consumer goods industrial system with wide coverage and a relatively complete structure, providing consumers around the world, including in Australia, with a rich variety of cost-effective goods.
He believed that this exhibition will become an important stage for the full display of Chinese consumer goods in Australia, and also provide an important platform for more Australian consumers to understand and love Chinese consumer goods at home.
""I'm looking forward to seeing more than 400 Chinese companies exhibit their goods at the International Convention Center in September,"" said Damian Meduri, associate director of Priority Markets (Greater China) with the New South Wales (NSW) Government's international trade and investment group.
""Having access to a wide range of affordable goods and services imported from China has benefited both NSW consumers and businesses by improving living standards and business efficiency,"" he said.
CCF Australia is organized by the Trade Development Bureau of the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, together with Zhejiang Broad International Convention & Exhibition Co., Ltd, Jiangsu Trade Promotion International Conference & Exhibition Co., Ltd, Shanghai International Exhibition (Group) Co., Ltd and Shandong Better Exhibition Engineering Co., Ltd.
It is also strategically supported by Messe Frankfurt, one of the world's largest trade fair, congress and event organizers.
CCF Australia is expected to gather nearly 400 Chinese companies and cover an exhibition area of over 10,000 square meters, making it the largest specialized consumer goods exhibition in Australia with the most Chinese participants.

U.S. President Joe Biden's recent debate against his rival Donald Trump seems to have confirmed some people's worst fears. Critics said the oldest sitting president in U.S. history is in a state of cognitive decline.
WASHINGTON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Joe Biden is facing the worst crisis of his 50-year political career.
The recent debate against rival Donald Trump seems to have confirmed some people's worst fears. Critics said the oldest sitting president in U.S. history is in a state of cognitive decline.
That's because two weeks ago, Biden appeared in a nationally televised debate to be physically frail, confused and befuddled.
Now, several members of Biden's party are calling for the president's withdrawal from the presidential election. Over 10 Democrats in the House of Representatives have urged Biden to step aside, and Vermont Senator Peter Welch became the first Democratic senator to make this request.
""People within Biden's own party are calling for him to step aside and let the Democratic convention pick another candidate for a three-month race against Trump,"" Brookings Institution Senior Fellow Darrell West told Xinhua.
On Wednesday, former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, a long-time ally of Biden, did not directly respond when asked if she supports Biden's continuation in the campaign. Instead, she stated that ""it's up to the president to decide if he is going to run"" and noted that ""time is running short.""
The media chorus has been going strong for the two weeks since the debate, with a daily avalanche of opinion pieces calling on Biden to withdraw.
The New York Times' chief White House correspondent, Peter Baker, wrote that Biden's ""halting and disjointed performance"" prompted a ""wave of panic among Democrats."" National Public Radio reported that private fears within the Democratic Party about Biden are ""slowly going public.""
NATO PRESS CONFERENCE
Biden hosted a major NATO summit in Washington this week. With persistent concerns within the Democratic Party, all eyes were on the president as he made a concerted effort to alleviate fears of his age and mental fitness.
In a speech before the press conference, he misnamed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as ""President Putin."" During the press conference, Biden accidentally referred to Vice President Kamala Harris as ""Vice President Trump.""
Biden's press conference started later than scheduled. For about an hour, he answered questions from roughly 10 media outlets, much of which focused on whether he should continue to run for office. Biden firmly reiterated his intention to stay in the race.
Analysts said Biden answered reporters' questions on foreign policy and NATO policy and stumbled somewhat on other answers.

Answering questions on his cognitive condition, Biden told reporters: ""The only thing age does is create a little bit of wisdom.""
""No one will be satisfied no matter how many tests Biden agrees to, no matter how many interviews he does, etc.,"" said Ashley Parker, a White House reporter for The Washington Post. ""And again, that's the challenge, because he needs to do something that will put this discussion about his fitness to rest, and allow the Democrats to return to talking about Trump.""
BIDEN CALLS FOR UNITY
Last week, Biden appeared for an interview on the network ABC to reassure voters that he is the person for the job.
Christopher Galdieri, a political science professor at Saint Anselm College in the state of New Hampshire, told Xinhua: ""To a certain extent, I think things like his ABC interview and other appearances have helped. The big problem is that none of these have been the sort of platform that the debate was. And these efforts haven't stopped calls from elected Democrats and fundraisers for the president to bow out of the race.""
Notably, while doubts about Biden are increasing within the party, those publicly calling for his withdrawal remain in the minority, possibly due to a lack of consensus on a successor candidate.
Pushing Biden to resign abruptly could prevent any Democratic leader from uniting the party. It could lead to internal chaos, dealing a devastating blow to the Democrats in the presidential election in early November.
As Biden stated in a letter to Democratic lawmakers on Monday, there are only 42 days left until the Democratic National Convention officially announces the party's presidential nominee and only 119 days until the general election.
""Any weakening of resolve or lack of clarity about the task ahead only helps Trump and hurts us,"" Biden concluded. ""It is time to come together, move forward as a unified party, and defeat Donald Trump.""
BIDEN'S WOES BENEFIT TRUMP
According to the latest average of polls from Real Clear Politics, Trump has received a bump in key swing states, including Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, since the debate.
Those three states are crucial to winning the election, experts said.
Trump leads Biden in several other key swing states — some by significant margins.
On Thursday night, Trump ridiculed Biden in an online post following the NATO press conference, during which Biden mistakenly referred to his vice president as Trump.
""Crooked Joe begins his 'Big Boy' Press Conference with, 'I wouldn't have picked Vice President Trump to be vice president,"" Trump said in a post on his Truth Social site.
""Great job, Joe!""
With Trump leading Biden in election polls, NATO countries are concerned.
""Most allies see Trump as anti-NATO and isolationist-inclined ... They fear this will weaken the alliance and put in jeopardy U.S. support for Ukraine,"" William Courtney, a retired U.S. ambassador and adjunct senior fellow at the RAND Corporation, told Xinhua.
A report by The Hill pointed out that NATO's next secretary general, Mark Rutte, may face his biggest challenge with the potential return of Trump to the White House.
The report noted that the increasing likelihood of Trump being re-elected will only exacerbate Europe's concerns about the withdrawal of the United States from NATO under Trump's leadership.

ZHENGZHOU, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have unearthed the ruins of an inner city gate of the capital of the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1126). This discovery marks the largest and highest-scale city gate ruins from the Northern Song period found so far.
The ruins are located in the city of Kaifeng, which was the ancient capital of the Northern Song Dynasty for 168 years.
Jinglong Gate, the only inner city gate of the ancient capital discovered to date, is about 60 meters wide with the gateway extending 19.3 meters.
""The overall scale of Jinglong Gate is larger than the Shuntian Gate in the ancient capital of Song, which had earlier been discovered,"" said Wang Sanying, vice president of Kaifeng municipal institute of cultural heritage and archaeology.
He added that the discovery of the inner city gate holds great significance in locating the imperial city of the Northern Song Dynasty and the palaces within.
During the excavation that started in November, archaeologists also found overlapping walls built in different periods, ranging from the Tang Dynasty (618-907) to the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). This discovery shed further light on the historical evolution of Kaifeng.
The new discoveries proved that the Jin Dynasty (1115-1234), which overturned the Song regime, did not overlay its imperial capital on that of the Song as previously speculated by researchers.
The authorities have decided to carry out protective backfilling to bury the excavation site of Jinglong Gate ruins, as the location has been frequently hit by heavy rains and elevated flood risks.
Liu Haiwang, the Party chief of the Henan provincial institute of cultural heritage and archaeology, said that in the next step, the local government will optimize the excavation plan to better protect and display the historical site.

China,People.cn,"Zhao Tong, Liu Ning",Sports,2024-07-13,15:13,,,Paris 2024 Preview: China chasing continued success,"BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- With less than two weeks until the opening of the 2024 Paris Olympic Games, China announced a 716-member delegation, including 405 athletes, on Saturday, aiming to win more glory at the quadrennial sports extravaganza.
China has consistently finished in the top three positions in the Olympic medals table since Sydney 2000, and this trend is expected to continue in Paris.
Much of China's Olympic success relied on its squads in diving, shooting, gymnastics, table tennis, badminton and weightlifting - which have contributed a whopping 192 of China's total 263 gold medals at the Olympics since Los Angeles 1984.
During the Paris Olympic cycle, the country's ""six ace squads"" maintained a high level of performance across various competitions. Consequently, China is projected to finish second on total medals and should challenge the United States for first place on gold medals, according to Nielsen's Gracenote's latest Virtual Medal Table (VMT) forecast.
After missing out on the mixed doubles title in Tokyo, China's table tennis team will look to secure a clean sweep of all five Olympic titles this time around.
""We cannot take for granted that these five gold medals belong to China. All five gold medals are in Paris, and they are reserved for the brave and the wise, for those who excel the most,"" said Liu Guoliang, president of the Chinese Table Tennis Association.
China's table tennis icon Ma Long is now gearing up for his fourth Olympic appearance, leading China's men's team alongside world champions Wang Chuqin and Fan Zhendong, while Sun Yingsha, Chen Meng and Wang Manyu headline the women's squad.
""We have been fine-tuning our form for quite a long time, and we will give our all to achieve the best possible results in Paris,"" said women's world number one Sun Yingsha, who will compete in singles, mixed doubles, and team events.
China's diving squad includes five Olympic champions. Cao Yuan will become a four-time Olympian, while Quan Hongchan, Chen Yuxi, Wang Zongyuan and Xie Siyi will be competing in their second Olympic Games.
In the world championships held in February, China's diving team collected nine golds out of 13 events, and are hoping to continue that momentum in Paris.
""Our opponents are making rapid progress, and they will cause more trouble to the Chinese divers at the Olympic Games. But we are ready for the tense competitions and looking forward to a good performance,"" Chinese Diving Association president Zhou Jihong remarked.
China's shooting team will be another ambitious squad to watch, as it expects to improve on the haul of four gold medals it won three years ago.
As usual, the first gold medal of the Paris Olympics will be determined in shooting when the mixed team 10m air rifle event starts hours after the opening ceremony. China, represented by two pairs - world champions Han Jiayu and Du Linshu, and Olympic silver medalists Sheng Lihao and Huang Yuting - stands a good chance of claiming the coveted honor.
China's weightlifting team won seven golds and one silver at the last Olympics, but due to the limit of six athletes per event, they cannot replicate that success in Paris. The team boasts four Tokyo Olympic champions: Li Fabin, Shi Zhiyong, Hou Zhihui and Li Wenwen, while newcomers Liu Huanhua and Luo Shifang are also promising.
China's badminton team has secured two Olympic qualifications in all five individual events, making it the only team to achieve full participation in each individual event. During the Paris Olympic cycle, China has maintained its dominance in mixed doubles and women's doubles, with Zheng Siwei/Huang Yaqiong and Chen Qingchen/Jia Yifan ranking top in the world for a long time. But China's shuttlers face tough competition in the men's singles and men's doubles respectively.
With China striving to establish itself as a world-class sporting power, its attempts to expand its prowess to more mainstream sports, such as athletics, swimming and team ball sports, will undergo a stern test in Paris.
In athletics, China's star sprinter Su Bingtian, who ran an Asian record of 9.83 seconds in the men's 100m semifinal and finished sixth in the final at the Tokyo Olympics, will miss the Paris Olympics with injury. The country's hopes of winning a gold medal will rest on race walkers Liu Hong, Yang Jiayu and Ma Zhenhong. Gong Lijiao (women's shot put), who is set to make her fifth Olympic appearance in Paris, and Feng Bin (women's discus throw) are also likely to be podium contenders.
China's women's basketball team was given a favorable draw for the Paris Olympics, avoiding defending champions the USA and hosts France in the group stage. Their real test will start from the knockout stage.
Injuries have lately plagued the team, who won only one game in six overseas warm-up matches, including two heavy defeats to Australia.
""The team is overcoming difficulties and actively preparing. We are diligently training every day, and hoping to adjust the team's condition as quickly as possible,"" said head coach Zheng Wei.
As the country's only world title-winning ball sports team, China's women's volleyball squad delivered a major confidence boost by winning four matches in a row at the Hong Kong leg of the FIVB Women's Volleyball Nations League last month.
""At the Paris Olympics, we will give our all in every match and showcase the spirit of Chinese women's volleyball,"" said head coach Cai Bin.
Elsewhere, China's post-00s athletes will try to captivate global attention with medals in emerging Olympic sports such as breakdancing, sport climbing, skateboarding and surfing.

China,People.cn,"Zhao Tong, Liu Ning",Military,2024-07-13,11:42,,,"Ministry of National Defense: Separatists for ""Taiwan Independence"" Will be Caught no Matter Where They Hide","
Senior Colonel Zhang Xiaogang, spokesperson for China's Ministry of National Defense, made the remarks at a regular news conference on Friday.
Question: It's reported that Taiwan's military sent letters to local temples and churches asking for permission to use them as ammunition depots in war time, which sparked backlashes in some cities and counties. What's your comment on this?
Zhang Xiaogang: We have noted relevant reports. The DPP authorities are obstinate in seeking ""Taiwan Independence"" by force. Their attempts to use religious sites in wartime and turn local residents into human shields are appalling. National reunification is the right way forward, while ""Taiwan Independence"" only leads to a dead end. Separatists for ""Taiwan Independence"" will be caught no matter where they hide, and any scheme to resist reunification by force will fail.
