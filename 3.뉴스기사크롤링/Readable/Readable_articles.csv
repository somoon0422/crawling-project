Korea,The Readable,Oh Dain,World,20240705,0159,,,South Korea’s premier academic conference focuses on security issues,"Seoul, South Korea―IT21 Global Conference―A 30-year-old academic organization comprising 19,500 information technology researchers across South Korea kicked off its annual conference on Wednesday. This year’s event has been expanded to include 52 sessions over three days, with a particular focus on six national strategic technologies, including cybersecurity. The Korea Information Processing Society (KIPS) was founded in 1993 with the aim of contributing to the nation’s IT industry by establishing research foundations in information processing. Over the years, it has grown into a major academic community with 16 research subgroups, including the Data Privacy Research Group, and has more than 350 universities and companies as its members. KIPS publishes three periodic journals, including the ‘Journal of Information Processing Systems.’ “Since KIPS first launched the ‘IT21 Global Conference’ in 1996, our annual gathering has pioneered the way in increasing national competitiveness in IT,” said Paek Yun-heung, President of KIPS and Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Seoul National University, during the conference’s opening ceremony. “With top experts in the tech field as our speakers, we will be able to discuss how the latest advancements can be applied to the industry and review government policies in line with these developments,” Paek added. This year’s conference saw the highest participation to date, with around 500 researchers registered both in-person and online. Additionally, nine government agencies and research institutions co-hosted the event, including the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), the National Information Society Agency (NIA), the Korea Electronics Technology Institute (KETI), the Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information (KISTI), the Software Policy & Research Institute (SPRI), and the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI). Among the various sessions, cybersecurity gained significant attention, with scholars participating in 16 different sessions related to security and defense. On the first day of the event, the improvement of the network isolation policy drew particular interest from the audience. Network isolation, often referred to as network separation, is a tactic that divides a network into separate segments. In response to increasing cyber threats originating from North Korea, the South Korean government implemented a nationwide network isolation policy in the public sector in 2006. This policy requires all public officials to use separate networks when accessing internal or external resources. While the nation has benefited from this strict policy, it has become apparent that South Korea will struggle to adopt cutting-edge technologies, such as artificial intelligence and cloud computing, or advance its administrative infrastructure to defend against evolving cyberattacks without adjusting the policy. To address this, the South Korean government formed a taskforce earlier this year. Three experts from the taskforce, including Kim Chang-hoon, a Professor at Daegu University, took the stage at IT21 to share details about the policy improvements. Furthermore, in a separate session at the conference, Lee Woong-bi, an official from MSIT, revealed the government’s plan to launch an ‘AI Safety Research Institute’ on July 3. According to Lee, the AI Safety Research Institute will focus on developing safety frameworks and verification mechanisms related to AI technology. Last February, MSIT announced 12 national strategic technologies that have a direct impact on national security. These include the fields of semiconductors, rechargeable batteries, mobility, nuclear power, biotechnology, cybersecurity, AI, and quantum technology. An international wireless and mobile security conference was held in South Korea for the first time, attracting approximately 210 experts from around the world. On Monday, the Association for Computing Machinery Conference on Security and Privacy in Wireless and Mobile Networks (ACM WiSec) commenced its three-day event. The ACM, the world’s largest educational and scientific computing society, hosts over 170 events globally through its special interest groups. ACM WiSec is a premier conference sponsored by the ACM and its Special Interest Group on Security, Audit, and Control (SIGSAC). This year’s event, marking the 17th meeting, was organized by the Korea Institute of Information Security & Cryptology (KIISC).

Korea,The Readable,Shin Minkyung,Privacy,20240702,2320,,,South Korean soldier uses stolen personal information to obtain prescription drugs,"A South Korean army officer has been apprehended for stealing the personal information of approximately 90 former soldiers to obtain controlled substances. On June 21, authorities arrested a service member in his 40s, who serves as an officer in the army, on charges of violating narcotics control and privacy laws, as confirmed by a spokesperson from the Gyeonggi Hanam Police Station. The police explained that the soldier accessed personal details of over 90 former service members through the army’s internal network system, including names and resident registration numbers. Subsequently, he used this stolen information to create a counterfeit identification card, allowing him to obtain prescription medications without legitimate prescriptions. According to police reports, the soldier visited multiple hospitals in Seoul and the Gyeonggi region to obtain prescriptions for psychotropic drugs, specifically zolpidem, a narcotic used for sleep disorders. Additionally, on June 27, authorities arrested a woman in her 30s not affiliated with the military, for her involvement in the illegal procurement of drugs with the soldier. These crimes took place between December 2023 and June 2024. The criminal was exposed when one victim reported unauthorized prescriptions filled in his name to health authorities. When contacted for further details, the Gyeonggi Hanam Police Station declined to disclose additional information, citing the ongoing nature of the investigation. Meanwhile, responding to such incidents, the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) mandated a hospital identification check system effective May 20. This measure, as stated by MOHW, aims to prevent identity exploitation for obtaining health benefits, including prescription medications. The ministry highlighted, “Over the past five years, the National Health Insurance Service has identified an average of 35,000 cases of identity theft annually. However, the actual number is presumed to be considerably higher.” As drug trafficking is rising as a nationwide problem, South Korean prosecutors will form a drug squad which will specifically monitor the dark web and its illegal drug trade, reported local news outlets referring to an official document submitted by the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office on Thursday. According to the reports, the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office plans to launch a dedicated team of 15 personnel in three different regions in order to restrain drug trafficking which allegedly occurs through the dark web. The team will be installed in the District Prosecutors’ Office of each region, including Seoul, Incheon, and Busan, as early as January 2023. These regions are the gateways to South Korea since they have international airports and harbors. The drug squad on the dark web will reportedly focus on analyzing internet search records and IP addresses, in addition to tracking cryptocurrency. There are estimated to be 250,000 South Korean daily users of the dark web. The Korean prosecutors believe a great number of the users access the dark web for unlawful purposes, such as buying drugs. Last year, Korean law enforcement seized 1295.7kg (2856.5lbs) of drugs, which was an increase of eight times, compared to 2017.

READ MORE The Monti ransomware gang has claimed responsibility for a cyberattack on Wayne Memorial Hospital in Pennsylvania and has threatened to leak stolen data on Monday, July 8, 2024, unless their demands are met, according to Security Affairs. In a separate incident, the LockBit ransomware gang has added Fairfield Memorial Hospital in Illinois to their victim list and plans to leak stolen data on Wednesday, July 17, 2024, if their demands are not fulfilled. Cybersecurity experts note that Monti has been operating since June 2022, following the shutdown of the Conti ransomware gang. The two groups share similarities, with Monti operators reportedly using Conti’s leaked source code for their encryptor. Furthermore, they have adopted similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Monti targets both Windows and Linux systems and regularly exposes company data on their leak site. The group’s methods have drawn significant attention from cybersecurity experts due to their mirroring of Conti’s operations. READ MORE Data intelligence, recognized as a crucial technology in the artificial intelligence era, has become one of the most important tools for future enterprises. S2W, a company specializing in data intelligence, held a summit on Thursday to exchange insights on security and AI. A summit titled ‘SIS 2024 MERGE’ took place in Gangnam, Seoul, focusing on the theme ‘Future of AI and Security.’ The SIS, which stands for S2W Intelligence Summit, featured seven speech sessions and one discussion session. Eleven experts from various fields, including business, academia, and law, presented their insights on AI and cybersecurity from multiple perspectives. “We hope everyone gains insight into AI and security by connecting with people who share the same interests,” said Suh Sang-duk, chief executive officer of S2W, during the summit’s opening speech. READ MORE On Wednesday, a data intelligence expert warned that advances in generative artificial intelligence could accelerate the commoditization of hacking tools, making them more versatile and accessible in the cyber threat landscape. In an interview with The Readable, Park Keun-tae, Chief Technology Officer at S2W, pointed out that the cyber threat landscape is shifting towards an environment where attackers can execute sophisticated malicious activities without the usual technical expertise barriers. This indicates that loosely affiliated groups may soon handle all stages of their operations—tracking targets, deploying malicious code, negotiating with victims, and seeking financial gain through extortion—with unprecedented autonomy. The interview coincided with the third S2W Intelligence Summit (SIS), themed ‘The Future of AI and Security,’ held on July 4. The CTO of the South Korean data intelligence company emphasized that generative AI technology could accelerate this trend by replacing human operators, reducing the time and effort required for coordination and negotiation among hacking groups.

READ MORE A malicious application disguised as a utility and productivity tool has targeted South Korean Android users, aiming to steal their financial information, including banking usernames and passwords. On Thursday, the Financial Security Institution (FSI), which is responsible for responding to cyber threats in the financial services sector in South Korea, warned that a bogus application named ‘Anatsa’ has targeted 688 finance-related apps in 54 countries, including South Korea, in an attempt to steal users’ banking and financial information. Anatsa is an Android-based malicious application, also known as TeaBot, that launched a financial theft attack against European financial applications in early 2021. According to the FSI, hackers disseminated the Anatsa app by disguising it either as a PDF reader or QR code scanner and then uploading it to Google Play. When users downloaded the app, they encountered no initial difficulties, as it appeared and functioned normally. However, once users responded to a prompt to update the app, the Anatsa malware program was installed. READ MORE A cybersecurity expert has warned that North Korean cyberattack techniques have evolved significantly since a DDoS attack in 2009, posing an increasingly serious global threat. On Wednesday, Mun Chong-hyun, director of the Genians Security Center, discussed the evolution of the North Korean cyber threat at a seminar in Seoul, South Korea, which focused on North Korean hacking realities and countermeasures. According to a report by the National Intelligence Service (NIS), public institutions in South Korea faced an average of 1.62 million cyberattacks daily in 2023. Mun emphasized that approximately 80 percent of these attacks originated from North Korea. READ MORE The appellate court on Wednesday rejected the appeal of a 19-year-old convicted of hacking into teachers’ computers to steal examination papers and answers. The Gwangju District Court had sentenced him to a one-year prison term for violating the country’s information protection laws, emphasizing the severity of his actions. As per the court’s ruling, the defendant was detained accordingly. The decision comes as the Juvenile Act no longer applies to the defendant, who has reached adulthood. Last year, when he was under 18 years old, the lower court sentenced him to both long-term (18 months) and short-term (12 months) sentences under the country’s Juvenile Act, which applies to those under 19. The defendant appealed in April, arguing that the lower court’s rulings were too severe.

Korea,The Readable,Shin Minkyung,North Korea,20240703,2146,,,Expert warns North Korean hacking techniques continue to evolve,"A cybersecurity expert has warned that North Korean cyberattack techniques have evolved significantly since a DDoS attack in 2009, posing an increasingly serious global threat. On Wednesday, Mun Chong-hyun, director of the Genians Security Center, discussed the evolution of the North Korean cyber threat at a seminar in Seoul, South Korea, which focused on North Korean hacking realities and countermeasures. According to a report by the National Intelligence Service (NIS), public institutions in South Korea faced an average of 1.62 million cyberattacks daily in 2023. Mun emphasized that approximately 80 percent of these attacks originated from North Korea. The North Korean Reconnaissance General Bureau, responsible for military intelligence and espionage, was established in February 2009. The Bureau leads cyberattacks against South Korea, engaging in activities like cyberterrorism and hacker training. North Korea initiated aggressive cyberattacks following the DDoS attacks on July 7, 2009, specifically targeting South Korean government ministries, media websites, and banks. Mun emphasized that North Korea employs five distinct attack techniques for hacking. Among these, Spearphishing attacks, which involve attaching malicious files or links to emails, are the most prominent, accounting for 74 percent of all attempts at infiltration. The director cited a recent case in February 2024, where a reporter from the South Korean broadcasting company SBS was targeted via email by North Korean hackers. The hackers impersonated an employee of the National Assembly Research Service, initially building trust by sending seminar and forum requests before eventually sending malicious links. Mun also noted that North Korean hackers use specific language expressions, which allowed him to identify attackers from North Korea in the malware code. For instance, attackers referred to the virus as ‘Vee-roos’. “This is a habit in North Korean expression,” he explained. Furthermore, the director highlighted that other attack methods include planting malicious code on websites, targeting software supply chains, impersonating social networking service accounts, and spreading malicious code by posing as IT developers. He stressed that North Korea is no longer just targeting the government; all citizens are vulnerable. He called for raising national awareness to effectively address the problem. The seminar was hosted by Park Choong-kwon, a lawmaker and representative of the People Power Party, a prominent political party in South Korea. Park’s background is notable: born in North Korea, he played a key role in the development of the DPRK’s ballistic missile program. However, in 2009, Park defected to South Korea, where he sought to contribute his expertise. His unique perspective and experiences led to his election as the 22nd member of Congress, where he now holds office. “North Korea’s hacking technology is more advanced than when I was there,” Park said during the seminar. “Cybersecurity is the foundation of the entire national cyber system, and hacking is an urgent issue that Congress must address.” South Korea highlighted concerns on Thursday regarding North Korea’s cyber activities, malicious attacks being undertaken to generate funds for the nation’s illicit missile programs. South Korea called on the international community to work together to address the pressing threat. Hwang Joon-kook, South Korea’s ambassador to the United Nations, highlighted North Korea’s cyber activities as one of three areas of concern regarding malicious cyber behavior that the U.N. Security Council should address. “Illicit cyber activities pose significant challenges to the global non-proliferation framework. A prime example is the malicious cyber activities undertaken by North Korea,” the ambassador emphasized. Hwang highlighted findings from a U.N. expert report published last March, which disclosed that state-sponsored hacking activities fund 40% of the country’s weapons of mass destruction program. These comments were made during an Arria-formula meeting at the U.N. headquarters in New York, themed “Evolving Cyber Threat Landscape and Its Implications for the Maintenance of International Peace and Security.” South Korea spearheaded this informal cybersecurity event in collaboration with two co-hosts: the United States and Japan.
