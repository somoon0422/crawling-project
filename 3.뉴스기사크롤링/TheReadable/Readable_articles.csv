SouthKorea,The Readable,Oh Dain,World,2024-07-05,00:00,,,South Korea’s premier academic conference focuses on security issues,"Seoul, South Korea―IT21 Global Conference―A 30-year-old academic organization comprising 19,500 information technology researchers across South Korea kicked off its annual conference on Wednesday. This year’s event has been expanded to include 52 sessions over three days, with a particular focus on six national strategic technologies, including cybersecurity. The Korea Information Processing Society (KIPS) was founded in 1993 with the aim of contributing to the nation’s IT industry by establishing research foundations in information processing. Over the years, it has grown into a major academic community with 16 research subgroups, including the Data Privacy Research Group, and has more than 350 universities and companies as its members. KIPS publishes three periodic journals, including the ‘Journal of Information Processing Systems.’ “Since KIPS first launched the ‘IT21 Global Conference’ in 1996, our annual gathering has pioneered the way in increasing national competitiveness in IT,” said Paek Yun-heung, President of KIPS and Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Seoul National University, during the conference’s opening ceremony. “With top experts in the tech field as our speakers, we will be able to discuss how the latest advancements can be applied to the industry and review government policies in line with these developments,” Paek added. This year’s conference saw the highest participation to date, with around 500 researchers registered both in-person and online. Additionally, nine government agencies and research institutions co-hosted the event, including the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), the National Information Society Agency (NIA), the Korea Electronics Technology Institute (KETI), the Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information (KISTI), the Software Policy & Research Institute (SPRI), and the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI). Among the various sessions, cybersecurity gained significant attention, with scholars participating in 16 different sessions related to security and defense. On the first day of the event, the improvement of the network isolation policy drew particular interest from the audience. Network isolation, often referred to as network separation, is a tactic that divides a network into separate segments. In response to increasing cyber threats originating from North Korea, the South Korean government implemented a nationwide network isolation policy in the public sector in 2006. This policy requires all public officials to use separate networks when accessing internal or external resources. While the nation has benefited from this strict policy, it has become apparent that South Korea will struggle to adopt cutting-edge technologies, such as artificial intelligence and cloud computing, or advance its administrative infrastructure to defend against evolving cyberattacks without adjusting the policy. To address this, the South Korean government formed a taskforce earlier this year. Three experts from the taskforce, including Kim Chang-hoon, a Professor at Daegu University, took the stage at IT21 to share details about the policy improvements. Furthermore, in a separate session at the conference, Lee Woong-bi, an official from MSIT, revealed the government’s plan to launch an ‘AI Safety Research Institute’ on July 3. According to Lee, the AI Safety Research Institute will focus on developing safety frameworks and verification mechanisms related to AI technology. Last February, MSIT announced 12 national strategic technologies that have a direct impact on national security. These include the fields of semiconductors, rechargeable batteries, mobility, nuclear power, biotechnology, cybersecurity, AI, and quantum technology. An international wireless and mobile security conference was held in South Korea for the first time, attracting approximately 210 experts from around the world. On Monday, the Association for Computing Machinery Conference on Security and Privacy in Wireless and Mobile Networks (ACM WiSec) commenced its three-day event. The ACM, the world’s largest educational and scientific computing society, hosts over 170 events globally through its special interest groups. ACM WiSec is a premier conference sponsored by the ACM and its Special Interest Group on Security, Audit, and Control (SIGSAC). This year’s event, marking the 17th meeting, was organized by the Korea Institute of Information Security & Cryptology (KIISC).

SouthKorea,The Readable,Shin Minkyung,Privacy,2024-07-02,00:00,,,South Korean soldier uses stolen personal information to obtain prescription drugs,"A South Korean army officer has been apprehended for stealing the personal information of approximately 90 former soldiers to obtain controlled substances. On June 21, authorities arrested a service member in his 40s, who serves as an officer in the army, on charges of violating narcotics control and privacy laws, as confirmed by a spokesperson from the Gyeonggi Hanam Police Station. The police explained that the soldier accessed personal details of over 90 former service members through the army’s internal network system, including names and resident registration numbers. Subsequently, he used this stolen information to create a counterfeit identification card, allowing him to obtain prescription medications without legitimate prescriptions. According to police reports, the soldier visited multiple hospitals in Seoul and the Gyeonggi region to obtain prescriptions for psychotropic drugs, specifically zolpidem, a narcotic used for sleep disorders. Additionally, on June 27, authorities arrested a woman in her 30s not affiliated with the military, for her involvement in the illegal procurement of drugs with the soldier. These crimes took place between December 2023 and June 2024. The criminal was exposed when one victim reported unauthorized prescriptions filled in his name to health authorities. When contacted for further details, the Gyeonggi Hanam Police Station declined to disclose additional information, citing the ongoing nature of the investigation. Meanwhile, responding to such incidents, the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) mandated a hospital identification check system effective May 20. This measure, as stated by MOHW, aims to prevent identity exploitation for obtaining health benefits, including prescription medications. The ministry highlighted, “Over the past five years, the National Health Insurance Service has identified an average of 35,000 cases of identity theft annually. However, the actual number is presumed to be considerably higher.” As drug trafficking is rising as a nationwide problem, South Korean prosecutors will form a drug squad which will specifically monitor the dark web and its illegal drug trade, reported local news outlets referring to an official document submitted by the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office on Thursday. According to the reports, the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office plans to launch a dedicated team of 15 personnel in three different regions in order to restrain drug trafficking which allegedly occurs through the dark web. The team will be installed in the District Prosecutors’ Office of each region, including Seoul, Incheon, and Busan, as early as January 2023. These regions are the gateways to South Korea since they have international airports and harbors. The drug squad on the dark web will reportedly focus on analyzing internet search records and IP addresses, in addition to tracking cryptocurrency. There are estimated to be 250,000 South Korean daily users of the dark web. The Korean prosecutors believe a great number of the users access the dark web for unlawful purposes, such as buying drugs. Last year, Korean law enforcement seized 1295.7kg (2856.5lbs) of drugs, which was an increase of eight times, compared to 2017.

SouthKorea,The Readable,Nam Kuksung,Security,2024-07-08,00:00,,,"South Korean police faced over 20,000 hacking attempts in past five years","South Korea’s police agencies have been a continual target of malicious actors, facing more than 20,000 hacking attempts in the past five years. In a press release on Sunday, South Korean lawmaker Yang Bu-nam disclosed that the national police agency and its affiliated organizations experienced 20,008 hacking attempts from 2019 to 2023. The lawmaker noted that more than 1,600 attempts were made against law enforcement agencies from January to May this year, bringing the total to 21,645 cases. Based on documents submitted by the Korean National Police Agency, Yang stated that attackers focused on extorting massive amounts of personal information stored in the police agency’s databases. This type of attack accounted for around 40% of all hacking attempts detected in the past five years. Notably, the number of hacking attempts aimed at harvesting information about targeted networks and systems has increased since 2022, nearing 40% of the total attempts discovered this year. Alongside data extortion, the attackers carried out diverse hacking attempts including vulnerability exploitation, unauthorized access, and web defacement. Web defacement is a type of cyberattack where attackers infiltrate a website to defame the target, spread disinformation, or steal users’ personal information. The attacks originated from the United States, China, South Korea, Vietnam, and Taiwan, based on the final IP addresses of the attempts. Although the number of hacking attempts has decreased yearly from 5,022 in 2019 to 3,210 in 2023, Yang stressed the need to expand the police agency’s budget for defending its systems and information against malicious activities. The lawmaker noted that the budget increased to 1.7 billion won ($1.3 million) in 2022 but decreased to 1.4 billion won ($1 million) last year. “It is evident that attackers frequently target the police agency to extort information or gain unauthorized access to its systems. Additional measures are necessary to protect against severe damage,” asserted Yang. The Future Policing Policy Bureau at the Korean National Police Agency explained in an email statement to The Readable that the external hacking attempts did not result in successful breaches. The South Korean police added that they are continuing their efforts to secure the necessary budget to protect their network and data. While the official YouTube channel of the South Korean government was hacked early this month, a statistic was released to the public, showing that more than half a million hacking attempts were carried out against South Korean government agencies over the past six years. According to the Ministry of the Interior and Safety, the South Korean government has received 558,674 hacking attempts from January 2017 to July of this year. This number includes 66,475 hacking attempts which occurred during the first seven months of this year. In 2017, a total of 62,532 hacking attempts were detected. The volume of threats jumped in 2018 and 2019, which recorded 94,980 and 124,754 respectively. In 2020 and 2021, the volume remained above 100,000 for both years, which showed 108,810 and 101,123 individually. Throughout the entire period, attempts to steal information from the government was the number one goal among the various reasons for hacking, recording 228,950 (41%) attempts.

SouthKorea,The Readable,Shin Minkyung,North Korea,2024-07-03,00:00,,,Expert warns North Korean hacking techniques continue to evolve,"A cybersecurity expert has warned that North Korean cyberattack techniques have evolved significantly since a DDoS attack in 2009, posing an increasingly serious global threat. On Wednesday, Mun Chong-hyun, director of the Genians Security Center, discussed the evolution of the North Korean cyber threat at a seminar in Seoul, South Korea, which focused on North Korean hacking realities and countermeasures. According to a report by the National Intelligence Service (NIS), public institutions in South Korea faced an average of 1.62 million cyberattacks daily in 2023. Mun emphasized that approximately 80 percent of these attacks originated from North Korea. The North Korean Reconnaissance General Bureau, responsible for military intelligence and espionage, was established in February 2009. The Bureau leads cyberattacks against South Korea, engaging in activities like cyberterrorism and hacker training. North Korea initiated aggressive cyberattacks following the DDoS attacks on July 7, 2009, specifically targeting South Korean government ministries, media websites, and banks. Mun emphasized that North Korea employs five distinct attack techniques for hacking. Among these, Spearphishing attacks, which involve attaching malicious files or links to emails, are the most prominent, accounting for 74 percent of all attempts at infiltration. The director cited a recent case in February 2024, where a reporter from the South Korean broadcasting company SBS was targeted via email by North Korean hackers. The hackers impersonated an employee of the National Assembly Research Service, initially building trust by sending seminar and forum requests before eventually sending malicious links. Mun also noted that North Korean hackers use specific language expressions, which allowed him to identify attackers from North Korea in the malware code. For instance, attackers referred to the virus as ‘Vee-roos’. “This is a habit in North Korean expression,” he explained. Furthermore, the director highlighted that other attack methods include planting malicious code on websites, targeting software supply chains, impersonating social networking service accounts, and spreading malicious code by posing as IT developers. He stressed that North Korea is no longer just targeting the government; all citizens are vulnerable. He called for raising national awareness to effectively address the problem. The seminar was hosted by Park Choong-kwon, a lawmaker and representative of the People Power Party, a prominent political party in South Korea. Park’s background is notable: born in North Korea, he played a key role in the development of the DPRK’s ballistic missile program. However, in 2009, Park defected to South Korea, where he sought to contribute his expertise. His unique perspective and experiences led to his election as the 22nd member of Congress, where he now holds office. “North Korea’s hacking technology is more advanced than when I was there,” Park said during the seminar. “Cybersecurity is the foundation of the entire national cyber system, and hacking is an urgent issue that Congress must address.” South Korea highlighted concerns on Thursday regarding North Korea’s cyber activities, malicious attacks being undertaken to generate funds for the nation’s illicit missile programs. South Korea called on the international community to work together to address the pressing threat. Hwang Joon-kook, South Korea’s ambassador to the United Nations, highlighted North Korea’s cyber activities as one of three areas of concern regarding malicious cyber behavior that the U.N. Security Council should address. “Illicit cyber activities pose significant challenges to the global non-proliferation framework. A prime example is the malicious cyber activities undertaken by North Korea,” the ambassador emphasized. Hwang highlighted findings from a U.N. expert report published last March, which disclosed that state-sponsored hacking activities fund 40% of the country’s weapons of mass destruction program. These comments were made during an Arria-formula meeting at the U.N. headquarters in New York, themed “Evolving Cyber Threat Landscape and Its Implications for the Maintenance of International Peace and Security.” South Korea spearheaded this informal cybersecurity event in collaboration with two co-hosts: the United States and Japan.
