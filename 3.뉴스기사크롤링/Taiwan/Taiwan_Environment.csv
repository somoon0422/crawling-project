Taiwan,Taiwan Today,,environment,2024-06-28,00:00,,,MOENV holds international environmental protection meeting,"The Ministry of Environment’s Environmental Management Administration hosted the 2024 International Technical Exchange on Emerging Contaminants and Remedial Practice June 27-28 in the southern city of Tainan and online, underscoring the government’s commitment to tackling pollution.

Seven experts from Australia and the U.S. were invited to speak, and over 200 academic, governmental and industrial representatives from home and abroad participated in the event, the MOENV said. Taiwan is dedicated to investigating soil and groundwater pollution and related remediation techniques, the ministry said, adding that the country’s focus on cutting-edge technologies puts it at the forefront of the field in Asia.

Joining the symposium’s opening ceremony via videoconference, MOENV Minister Peng Chi-ming said that protecting soil and groundwater quality is the basis for maintaining both human and ecosystem health, and is critical to fulfilling multiple U.N. sustainable development goals. Finding new, more effective ways to deal with new pollutants is therefore a challenge of the utmost importance, he added.

Jane Nishida, assistant administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of International and Tribal Affairs who attended the conference virtually, said that the Taiwan-U.S. cooperation on environmental protection dated back to the 1990s. She emphasized that polluted soil and underground water pose a particularly severe threat to children, senior citizens and underprivileged groups, and said she hoped that the seminar would lead to fruitful professional exchanges that would ensure robust environmental protection.

As a major actor in environmental protection in the Asia-Pacific, Taiwan will continue to collaborate with other countries to research sustainable remediation techniques and preventative measures to jointly safeguard people and resources of the region, the MOENV vowed. (POC-E)

Taiwan,Taiwan Today,,environment,2024-06-20,00:00,,,Lai announces three new committees at the Presidential Office,"President Lai Ching-te announced the establishment of three committees at the Presidential Office June 19 to develop national strategies, engage in dialogue with civil society and deepen cooperation with the global community to chart Taiwan’s future.
 
Lai made the announcement at his first press conference since being sworn in, titled “Building Trust through Policy Initiatives: A New Taiwan for an Era of Innovation.” Convened by the president himself, the new committees aim to consolidate both public and private sector efforts and provide effective solutions to address the global challenges of climate change, social resilience and health.
 
According to the president, the National Climate Change Response Committee will promote climate governance from a national perspective to expand transnational cooperation. He expects the body to play a key role in helping Taiwan realize a net-zero pathway, build a sustainable green lifestyle and enhance environmental resilience to foster a sustainable homeland.
 
The National Whole-of-Society Resilience Committee aims to enhance societal resilience in the face of severe disasters caused by earthquakes and climate change, as well as aggression seeking to disrupt regional peace and stability, Lai said. Specific goals include expanding training and utilization of civilian forces, stepping up material preparation and critical supply distribution systems and strengthening energy and vital infrastructural security, he added.
 
To address the challenges of the post-pandemic era, Lai said the Healthy Taiwan Promotion Committee will advance the Healthy Taiwan Cultivation Plan and improve the employment environment to attract and retain health professionals. It will also optimize the National Health Insurance system for sustainable operation, so that people can live longer and enjoy healthier lives, the president said.
 
Lai said the three committees signify unity and a spirit of collaboration within the administration and across ministries, disciplines and sectors. By harnessing the power of all segments of society, Taiwan can address pressing issues and create its strategies as a global solution, he added. (SFC-E)
