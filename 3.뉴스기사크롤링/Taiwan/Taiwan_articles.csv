Starmer, leader of the Labour Party and member of the House of Commons, visited Taiwan in 2016 and 2018 to meet with then-Vice President Chen Chien-jen and then-Minister of Justice Chiu Tai-shan, the ministry said, adding that Starmer has increased his support for Taiwan and cross-strait security since he was elected head of his party in 2020.
 
Other LP members have also paid growing attention to Taiwan, as evidenced by a March delegation led by Lord Leong CBE, co-chair of Labour Friends of Taiwan and shadow spokesperson for business and trade, the MOFA said. Group members met with former President Tsai Ing-wen and pledged to strengthen bilateral exchanges in areas spanning culture, economy and education, the ministry added.
 
Taiwan and the U.K. have worked closely in fields such as technology, trade and renewable energy, the MOFA said, citing the Enhanced Trade Partnership Arrangement signed last November and a memorandum of understanding on organic agriculture cooperation inked in May.
 
The two sides share the universal values of freedom, democracy and respect for the rule of law, the MOFA said. The government is committed to working with the Starmer administration to deepen mutually beneficial partnerships while jointly safeguarding peace, stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific, the ministry added.
 
On its official X account, the MOFA said: “Congratulations to @UKLabour leader @Keir_Starmer on his appointment as #UK prime minister.

Taiwan,Taiwan Today,Unknown,politics,2024-07-08,00:00,1970-01-01,00:00,MOFA thanks Deutscher Bundestag for supporting Taiwan,"The passage of a motion by the foreign affairs committee of the Deutscher Bundestag stressing the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait is sincerely appreciated by the government and people, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said July 6.
 
According to the MOFA, the motion said the security of Europe and the Indo-Pacific region are closely intertwined, and that the commitment to security and stability in the region is in the immediate interest of Germany and the EU.
 
The ministry said that the German parliament is deeply concerned about tensions in the region, adding that it opposes unilateral changes to the cross-strait status quo, and that changes must only be made peacefully and by mutual agreement.
 
The proposal also recognizes the contribution of the German-Taiwan dialogue platform to promoting civil society exchanges; supports Taiwan’s participation in global entities such as the World Health Organization; and calls on the EU to deepen trade ties and supply chain ocoperation with Taiwan; and calls for expanded education and research exchanges between Taiwan and Germany, the MOFA added.
 
This supportive legislation follows similar stances expressed by the German government in recent years, the ministry said. These include the section included in the country’s governing coalition deal unveiled in November 2021 backing Taiwan’s WHO participation; and the joint statements following the Group of Seven Summit and foreign ministers’ meetings in 2022 during Germany’s presidency.

The president made the remarks while receiving a delegation led by Texas Governor Greg Abbott July 7 at the Presidential Office in Taipei City.

According to Lai, investment in the U.S. state by Taiwan businesses has exceeded US$12 billion. Taiwan became its ninth-largest export market in 2023, with a trade volume of US$11.5 billion, he said.

Taiwan is ramping up its artificial intelligence, defense, next-generation communication and semiconductor industries, Lai said, adding that the country can benefit from working more closely with Texas’ mature counterpart sectors.

Lai also lauded the opening of the State of Texas Taiwan Office, which he said would create myriad new cooperation opportunities between the two sides. Texas is the 23rd U.S. state to set up such a center in Taiwan, he added.

The president took the opportunity to express appreciation for Abbott’s support of academic exchanges, as evidenced by the establishment of the first Mandarin center at the University of St. Thomas in Houston. This was followed by the first Center for Taiwan Studies launched at the University of Texas at Austin in 2021, Lai added.

In response, Abbott said Taiwan plays an important global role in innovation, semiconductors, technology and trade and has contributed significantly to democracy and peace. The governor pledged to assist Taiwan corporations in Texas to ensure smooth development.

Later the same day, Abbott and Economic Affairs Minister Kuo Jyh-huei inked a statement of intent on economic development, which is expected to lay a foundation for collaboration in electric cars, energy resilience, innovative technologies and semiconductors, the Ministry of Economic Affairs said.

At the signing, Kuo said Texas is a major investment target for Taiwan corporations and vowed that the ministry would cooperate with the state government to foster a robust supply chain ecosystem. (POC-E)

The bureau said while Taiwan is not a signatory of the STCW, the government began conducting the quinquennial assessment in 2004 to ensure that local seafarers’ training and certifications were in line with global standards.
 
The government will continue to take all necessary steps to ensure that Taiwan maritime professionals fully meet the requirements of STCW for sustainable maritime sector development, the bureau added. (SFC-E)

Taiwan,Taiwan Today,Unknown,environment,2024-06-28,00:00,1970-01-01,00:00,MOENV holds international environmental protection meeting,"The Ministry of Environment’s Environmental Management Administration hosted the 2024 International Technical Exchange on Emerging Contaminants and Remedial Practice June 27-28 in the southern city of Tainan and online, underscoring the government’s commitment to tackling pollution.

Seven experts from Australia and the U.S. were invited to speak, and over 200 academic, governmental and industrial representatives from home and abroad participated in the event, the MOENV said. Taiwan is dedicated to investigating soil and groundwater pollution and related remediation techniques, the ministry said, adding that the country’s focus on cutting-edge technologies puts it at the forefront of the field in Asia.

Joining the symposium’s opening ceremony via videoconference, MOENV Minister Peng Chi-ming said that protecting soil and groundwater quality is the basis for maintaining both human and ecosystem health, and is critical to fulfilling multiple U.N. sustainable development goals. Finding new, more effective ways to deal with new pollutants is therefore a challenge of the utmost importance, he added.

Jane Nishida, assistant administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of International and Tribal Affairs who attended the conference virtually, said that the Taiwan-U.S. cooperation on environmental protection dated back to the 1990s. She emphasized that polluted soil and underground water pose a particularly severe threat to children, senior citizens and underprivileged groups, and said she hoped that the seminar would lead to fruitful professional exchanges that would ensure robust environmental protection.

As a major actor in environmental protection in the Asia-Pacific, Taiwan will continue to collaborate with other countries to research sustainable remediation techniques and preventative measures to jointly safeguard people and resources of the region, the MOENV vowed. (POC-E)
