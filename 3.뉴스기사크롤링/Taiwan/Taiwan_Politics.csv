Taiwan,Taiwan Today,,politics,2024-07-08,00:00,,,MOFA congratulates new UK prime minister,"The government and people of Taiwan extended their warmest congratulations July 5 to Keir Starmer, who was appointed by King Charles III as the U.K.’s new prime minister, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
 
Starmer, leader of the Labour Party and member of the House of Commons, visited Taiwan in 2016 and 2018 to meet with then-Vice President Chen Chien-jen and then-Minister of Justice Chiu Tai-shan, the ministry said, adding that Starmer has increased his support for Taiwan and cross-strait security since he was elected head of his party in 2020.
 
Other LP members have also paid growing attention to Taiwan, as evidenced by a March delegation led by Lord Leong CBE, co-chair of Labour Friends of Taiwan and shadow spokesperson for business and trade, the MOFA said. Group members met with former President Tsai Ing-wen and pledged to strengthen bilateral exchanges in areas spanning culture, economy and education, the ministry added.
 
Taiwan and the U.K. have worked closely in fields such as technology, trade and renewable energy, the MOFA said, citing the Enhanced Trade Partnership Arrangement signed last November and a memorandum of understanding on organic agriculture cooperation inked in May.
 
The two sides share the universal values of freedom, democracy and respect for the rule of law, the MOFA said. The government is committed to working with the Starmer administration to deepen mutually beneficial partnerships while jointly safeguarding peace, stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific, the ministry added.
 
On its official X account, the MOFA said: “Congratulations to @UKLabour leader @Keir_Starmer on his appointment as #UK prime minister. As a fellow force for good, #Taiwan looks forward to further strengthening partnership with the new #British administration in areas our interests & values align.” (YCH-E)

Taiwan,Taiwan Today,,politics,2024-07-08,00:00,,,MOFA thanks Deutscher Bundestag for supporting Taiwan,"The passage of a motion by the foreign affairs committee of the Deutscher Bundestag stressing the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait is sincerely appreciated by the government and people, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said July 6.
 
According to the MOFA, the motion said the security of Europe and the Indo-Pacific region are closely intertwined, and that the commitment to security and stability in the region is in the immediate interest of Germany and the EU.
 
The ministry said that the German parliament is deeply concerned about tensions in the region, adding that it opposes unilateral changes to the cross-strait status quo, and that changes must only be made peacefully and by mutual agreement.
 
The proposal also recognizes the contribution of the German-Taiwan dialogue platform to promoting civil society exchanges; supports Taiwan’s participation in global entities such as the World Health Organization; and calls on the EU to deepen trade ties and supply chain ocoperation with Taiwan; and calls for expanded education and research exchanges between Taiwan and Germany, the MOFA added.
 
This supportive legislation follows similar stances expressed by the German government in recent years, the ministry said. These include the section included in the country’s governing coalition deal unveiled in November 2021 backing Taiwan’s WHO participation; and the joint statements following the Group of Seven Summit and foreign ministers’ meetings in 2022 during Germany’s presidency.
