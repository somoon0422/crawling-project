SouthKorea,The Readable,Oh Dain,World,2024-07-05,00:00,,,South Korea’s premier academic conference focuses on security issues,"Seoul, South Korea―IT21 Global Conference―A 30-year-old academic organization comprising 19,500 information technology researchers across South Korea kicked off its annual conference on Wednesday. This year’s event has been expanded to include 52 sessions over three days, with a particular focus on six national strategic technologies, including cybersecurity. The Korea Information Processing Society (KIPS) was founded in 1993 with the aim of contributing to the nation’s IT industry by establishing research foundations in information processing. Over the years, it has grown into a major academic community with 16 research subgroups, including the Data Privacy Research Group, and has more than 350 universities and companies as its members. KIPS publishes three periodic journals, including the ‘Journal of Information Processing Systems.’ “Since KIPS first launched the ‘IT21 Global Conference’ in 1996, our annual gathering has pioneered the way in increasing national competitiveness in IT,” said Paek Yun-heung, President of KIPS and Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Seoul National University, during the conference’s opening ceremony. “With top experts in the tech field as our speakers, we will be able to discuss how the latest advancements can be applied to the industry and review government policies in line with these developments,” Paek added. This year’s conference saw the highest participation to date, with around 500 researchers registered both in-person and online. Additionally, nine government agencies and research institutions co-hosted the event, including the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), the National Information Society Agency (NIA), the Korea Electronics Technology Institute (KETI), the Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information (KISTI), the Software Policy & Research Institute (SPRI), and the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI). Among the various sessions, cybersecurity gained significant attention, with scholars participating in 16 different sessions related to security and defense. On the first day of the event, the improvement of the network isolation policy drew particular interest from the audience. Network isolation, often referred to as network separation, is a tactic that divides a network into separate segments. In response to increasing cyber threats originating from North Korea, the South Korean government implemented a nationwide network isolation policy in the public sector in 2006. This policy requires all public officials to use separate networks when accessing internal or external resources. While the nation has benefited from this strict policy, it has become apparent that South Korea will struggle to adopt cutting-edge technologies, such as artificial intelligence and cloud computing, or advance its administrative infrastructure to defend against evolving cyberattacks without adjusting the policy. To address this, the South Korean government formed a taskforce earlier this year. Three experts from the taskforce, including Kim Chang-hoon, a Professor at Daegu University, took the stage at IT21 to share details about the policy improvements. Furthermore, in a separate session at the conference, Lee Woong-bi, an official from MSIT, revealed the government’s plan to launch an ‘AI Safety Research Institute’ on July 3. According to Lee, the AI Safety Research Institute will focus on developing safety frameworks and verification mechanisms related to AI technology. Last February, MSIT announced 12 national strategic technologies that have a direct impact on national security. These include the fields of semiconductors, rechargeable batteries, mobility, nuclear power, biotechnology, cybersecurity, AI, and quantum technology. An international wireless and mobile security conference was held in South Korea for the first time, attracting approximately 210 experts from around the world. On Monday, the Association for Computing Machinery Conference on Security and Privacy in Wireless and Mobile Networks (ACM WiSec) commenced its three-day event. The ACM, the world’s largest educational and scientific computing society, hosts over 170 events globally through its special interest groups. ACM WiSec is a premier conference sponsored by the ACM and its Special Interest Group on Security, Audit, and Control (SIGSAC). This year’s event, marking the 17th meeting, was organized by the Korea Institute of Information Security & Cryptology (KIISC).

SouthKorea,The Readable,Shin Minkyung,Privacy,2024-07-02,00:00,,,South Korean soldier uses stolen personal information to obtain prescription drugs,"A South Korean army officer has been apprehended for stealing the personal information of approximately 90 former soldiers to obtain controlled substances. On June 21, authorities arrested a service member in his 40s, who serves as an officer in the army, on charges of violating narcotics control and privacy laws, as confirmed by a spokesperson from the Gyeonggi Hanam Police Station. The police explained that the soldier accessed personal details of over 90 former service members through the army’s internal network system, including names and resident registration numbers. Subsequently, he used this stolen information to create a counterfeit identification card, allowing him to obtain prescription medications without legitimate prescriptions. According to police reports, the soldier visited multiple hospitals in Seoul and the Gyeonggi region to obtain prescriptions for psychotropic drugs, specifically zolpidem, a narcotic used for sleep disorders. Additionally, on June 27, authorities arrested a woman in her 30s not affiliated with the military, for her involvement in the illegal procurement of drugs with the soldier. These crimes took place between December 2023 and June 2024. The criminal was exposed when one victim reported unauthorized prescriptions filled in his name to health authorities. When contacted for further details, the Gyeonggi Hanam Police Station declined to disclose additional information, citing the ongoing nature of the investigation. Meanwhile, responding to such incidents, the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) mandated a hospital identification check system effective May 20. This measure, as stated by MOHW, aims to prevent identity exploitation for obtaining health benefits, including prescription medications. The ministry highlighted, “Over the past five years, the National Health Insurance Service has identified an average of 35,000 cases of identity theft annually. However, the actual number is presumed to be considerably higher.” As drug trafficking is rising as a nationwide problem, South Korean prosecutors will form a drug squad which will specifically monitor the dark web and its illegal drug trade, reported local news outlets referring to an official document submitted by the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office on Thursday. According to the reports, the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office plans to launch a dedicated team of 15 personnel in three different regions in order to restrain drug trafficking which allegedly occurs through the dark web. The team will be installed in the District Prosecutors’ Office of each region, including Seoul, Incheon, and Busan, as early as January 2023. These regions are the gateways to South Korea since they have international airports and harbors. The drug squad on the dark web will reportedly focus on analyzing internet search records and IP addresses, in addition to tracking cryptocurrency. There are estimated to be 250,000 South Korean daily users of the dark web. The Korean prosecutors believe a great number of the users access the dark web for unlawful purposes, such as buying drugs. Last year, Korean law enforcement seized 1295.7kg (2856.5lbs) of drugs, which was an increase of eight times, compared to 2017.

SouthKorea,The Readable,Nam Kuksung,Security,2024-07-08,00:00,,,"South Korean police faced over 20,000 hacking attempts in past five years","South Korea’s police agencies have been a continual target of malicious actors, facing more than 20,000 hacking attempts in the past five years. In a press release on Sunday, South Korean lawmaker Yang Bu-nam disclosed that the national police agency and its affiliated organizations experienced 20,008 hacking attempts from 2019 to 2023. The lawmaker noted that more than 1,600 attempts were made against law enforcement agencies from January to May this year, bringing the total to 21,645 cases. Based on documents submitted by the Korean National Police Agency, Yang stated that attackers focused on extorting massive amounts of personal information stored in the police agency’s databases. This type of attack accounted for around 40% of all hacking attempts detected in the past five years. Notably, the number of hacking attempts aimed at harvesting information about targeted networks and systems has increased since 2022, nearing 40% of the total attempts discovered this year. Alongside data extortion, the attackers carried out diverse hacking attempts including vulnerability exploitation, unauthorized access, and web defacement. Web defacement is a type of cyberattack where attackers infiltrate a website to defame the target, spread disinformation, or steal users’ personal information. The attacks originated from the United States, China, South Korea, Vietnam, and Taiwan, based on the final IP addresses of the attempts. Although the number of hacking attempts has decreased yearly from 5,022 in 2019 to 3,210 in 2023, Yang stressed the need to expand the police agency’s budget for defending its systems and information against malicious activities. The lawmaker noted that the budget increased to 1.7 billion won ($1.3 million) in 2022 but decreased to 1.4 billion won ($1 million) last year. “It is evident that attackers frequently target the police agency to extort information or gain unauthorized access to its systems. Additional measures are necessary to protect against severe damage,” asserted Yang. The Future Policing Policy Bureau at the Korean National Police Agency explained in an email statement to The Readable that the external hacking attempts did not result in successful breaches. The South Korean police added that they are continuing their efforts to secure the necessary budget to protect their network and data. While the official YouTube channel of the South Korean government was hacked early this month, a statistic was released to the public, showing that more than half a million hacking attempts were carried out against South Korean government agencies over the past six years. According to the Ministry of the Interior and Safety, the South Korean government has received 558,674 hacking attempts from January 2017 to July of this year. This number includes 66,475 hacking attempts which occurred during the first seven months of this year. In 2017, a total of 62,532 hacking attempts were detected. The volume of threats jumped in 2018 and 2019, which recorded 94,980 and 124,754 respectively. In 2020 and 2021, the volume remained above 100,000 for both years, which showed 108,810 and 101,123 individually. Throughout the entire period, attempts to steal information from the government was the number one goal among the various reasons for hacking, recording 228,950 (41%) attempts.

SouthKorea,The Readable,Shin Minkyung,North Korea,2024-07-03,00:00,,,Expert warns North Korean hacking techniques continue to evolve,"A cybersecurity expert has warned that North Korean cyberattack techniques have evolved significantly since a DDoS attack in 2009, posing an increasingly serious global threat. On Wednesday, Mun Chong-hyun, director of the Genians Security Center, discussed the evolution of the North Korean cyber threat at a seminar in Seoul, South Korea, which focused on North Korean hacking realities and countermeasures. According to a report by the National Intelligence Service (NIS), public institutions in South Korea faced an average of 1.62 million cyberattacks daily in 2023. Mun emphasized that approximately 80 percent of these attacks originated from North Korea. The North Korean Reconnaissance General Bureau, responsible for military intelligence and espionage, was established in February 2009. The Bureau leads cyberattacks against South Korea, engaging in activities like cyberterrorism and hacker training. North Korea initiated aggressive cyberattacks following the DDoS attacks on July 7, 2009, specifically targeting South Korean government ministries, media websites, and banks. Mun emphasized that North Korea employs five distinct attack techniques for hacking. Among these, Spearphishing attacks, which involve attaching malicious files or links to emails, are the most prominent, accounting for 74 percent of all attempts at infiltration. The director cited a recent case in February 2024, where a reporter from the South Korean broadcasting company SBS was targeted via email by North Korean hackers. The hackers impersonated an employee of the National Assembly Research Service, initially building trust by sending seminar and forum requests before eventually sending malicious links. Mun also noted that North Korean hackers use specific language expressions, which allowed him to identify attackers from North Korea in the malware code. For instance, attackers referred to the virus as ‘Vee-roos’. “This is a habit in North Korean expression,” he explained. Furthermore, the director highlighted that other attack methods include planting malicious code on websites, targeting software supply chains, impersonating social networking service accounts, and spreading malicious code by posing as IT developers. He stressed that North Korea is no longer just targeting the government; all citizens are vulnerable. He called for raising national awareness to effectively address the problem. The seminar was hosted by Park Choong-kwon, a lawmaker and representative of the People Power Party, a prominent political party in South Korea. Park’s background is notable: born in North Korea, he played a key role in the development of the DPRK’s ballistic missile program. However, in 2009, Park defected to South Korea, where he sought to contribute his expertise. His unique perspective and experiences led to his election as the 22nd member of Congress, where he now holds office. “North Korea’s hacking technology is more advanced than when I was there,” Park said during the seminar. “Cybersecurity is the foundation of the entire national cyber system, and hacking is an urgent issue that Congress must address.” South Korea highlighted concerns on Thursday regarding North Korea’s cyber activities, malicious attacks being undertaken to generate funds for the nation’s illicit missile programs. South Korea called on the international community to work together to address the pressing threat. Hwang Joon-kook, South Korea’s ambassador to the United Nations, highlighted North Korea’s cyber activities as one of three areas of concern regarding malicious cyber behavior that the U.N. Security Council should address. “Illicit cyber activities pose significant challenges to the global non-proliferation framework. A prime example is the malicious cyber activities undertaken by North Korea,” the ambassador emphasized. Hwang highlighted findings from a U.N. expert report published last March, which disclosed that state-sponsored hacking activities fund 40% of the country’s weapons of mass destruction program. These comments were made during an Arria-formula meeting at the U.N. headquarters in New York, themed “Evolving Cyber Threat Landscape and Its Implications for the Maintenance of International Peace and Security.” South Korea spearheaded this informal cybersecurity event in collaboration with two co-hosts: the United States and Japan.

Lai also lauded the opening of the State of Texas Taiwan Office, which he said would create myriad new cooperation opportunities between the two sides. Texas is the 23rd U.S. state to set up such a center in Taiwan, he added.

The president took the opportunity to express appreciation for Abbott’s support of academic exchanges, as evidenced by the establishment of the first Mandarin center at the University of St. Thomas in Houston. This was followed by the first Center for Taiwan Studies launched at the University of Texas at Austin in 2021, Lai added.

In response, Abbott said Taiwan plays an important global role in innovation, semiconductors, technology and trade and has contributed significantly to democracy and peace. The governor pledged to assist Taiwan corporations in Texas to ensure smooth development.

Later the same day, Abbott and Economic Affairs Minister Kuo Jyh-huei inked a statement of intent on economic development, which is expected to lay a foundation for collaboration in electric cars, energy resilience, innovative technologies and semiconductors, the Ministry of Economic Affairs said.

At the signing, Kuo said Texas is a major investment target for Taiwan corporations and vowed that the ministry would cooperate with the state government to foster a robust supply chain ecosystem. (POC-E)

USA,CNN,Lauren Said-Moorhouse,World,,,2024-07-08,11:51,Ukrainian children’s hospital attacked as Russian strikes on cities kill at least 31,"A Russian missile strike partially destroyed a children’s hospital in Kyiv on Monday, causing terrified patients and their families to flee for their lives, as officials fear more people could be trapped beneath the rubble. Moscow launched a brazen daytime aerial assault on targets in cities across Ukraine during morning rush hour, killing at least 31 people and injuring 125 others, according to Ukraine’s emergency service. In an update on Telegram, the emergency service said the latest figure included the number of dead and injured in the capital, which now stands at 20 people dead and 61 others hurt. Two people were killed and at least 10 were injured in the strike on Kyiv’s Okhmatdyt hospital. The facility is Ukraine’s largest children’s medical center and has been vital in the care of some the sickest children from across the country. Every year, around 7,000 surgeries – including treatments for cancer and hematological diseases – are conducted at the hospital, according to Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets. Videos from the scene showed volunteers working with police and security services to sift through the rubble as smoke billowed from the hospital, as staff described how they tried to rush children to safety in the wake of the attack. Ukraine’s health minister Viktor Liashko said intensive care units, oncology departments and surgery units had been damaged. “The key task here is to get people out of the rubble and provide assistance to those we can reach, as we have already taken out all the first ones,” he said in a Telegram post. The attacks were part of a rare daylight bombardment on Ukrainian cities, some of which are heavily populated areas far from the front lines. It came a day before US President Joe Biden hosts a crucial NATO Summit in Washington, where new announcements over the alliance’s military, political and financial support for Kyiv are expected. Russia’s defense ministry on Monday claimed that Moscow had struck “military industrial facilities of Ukraine and air bases of the Ukrainian armed forces” using long-range, high-precision weapons. Natalia Sardudinova, a senior nurse, described the moment the strike hit the hospital saying that “it was scary, but we survived.” “It was loud, the windows were crunching,” she told CNN. “As soon as the alarm sounded, the children were taken out into the corridor.” She said two children had been in the operating theaters at the time of the blast, and both were relocated to the basement shelter once their procedures were completed. “Everything was in smoke, there was no air to breathe. The doctor was cut by shrapnel. The windows and doors were blown out. One nurse in the hospital was heavily injured,” Sardudinova added. “My hands are still shaking. They don’t let anyone in now, they are afraid it will collapse.” Yulia Vasylenko, the mother of an 11-year-old cancer patient at the hospital, said her son Denys was evacuated outside following the strike. “My son is on painkillers. He has cancer. He has been without medication for half a day. He was brought down the stairs from the third floor. There was smoke (and) heavy dust,” she said. Iryna Filimonova, a senior nurse at the pediatric urology department, told CNN an operation on a 2-year-old was underway when the strike happened. “The lights went out, everything went out. We pulled out the instruments, shining flashlights. Everything was sewn up quickly,” Filimonova said. “The baby was brought down (to the shelter). I immediately ran to help clear the rubble. Some of my nursing colleagues who worked in the operating theaters and some doctors were cut by glass fragments. Our department was destroyed.” Another operating theater nurse, Oksana Mosiychuk, said they sheltered in the emergency room when the explosion rocked the building. After that, she added, the medical team had to extinguish a blaze that broke out in their department, including an operating table which had caught fire. “Fortunately, everyone is alive. One of our colleagues was heavily injured, he had numerous cuts and shrapnel wounds, and was taken away by an ambulance. I also have minor shrapnel wounds, but I’m fine. It was very scary. I was scared for the children,” she said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksy said in a post on X that the exact number of casualties at the hospital was not yet known and that “there are people under the rubble” but that everyone from doctors to local residents are helping clear debris in the strike’s aftermath. “Apartment buildings, infrastructure, and a children’s hospital have been damaged. All services are engaged to rescue as many people as possible,” Zelensky wrote in a post on X. The bombardment struck targets in the capital Kyiv as well as in Dnipro, Kryvyi Rih, Slovyansk and Kramatorsk. Zelensky later called for a United Nations Security Council meeting, while vowing retaliation over Monday’s strikes. Ukraine shot down 30 out of 38 missiles launched by Russia during its attack on Monday, the commander of the Ukrainian Air Force said in a statement. Russian forces used ballistic, cruise, guided and air-launched ballistic missiles in the strikes, Mykola Oleshchuk also said. The Ukrainian security service said a cruise missile was used to attack Kyiv’s Okhmatdyt hospital. In reaction to Monday’s bombardment, Ukraine’s defense minister Rustem Umerov said the country’s infrastructure was targeted by four dozen Kalibr cruise missiles and Kinzhal aero ballistic missiles, launched from Russia’s Volgograd region. In a statement, Umerov continued to appeal for more air defense systems to support the war-torn country. Zelensky has repeatedly called on the West to provide it with more air defense systems to better protect its cities. Last month, he praised Biden for prioritizing the delivery of air defense systems after the two presidents signed a security agreement between their nations on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Italy. Umerov said Monday that Kyiv was continuing “to work to ensure that the systems promised by our partners arrive in Ukraine as soon as possible.” Air raid sirens continued to ring out over Kyiv in the aftermath, with CNN video showing people who had been evacuated outside the hospital pushing children on stretchers to safety in shelters. Scores of volunteers later dropped off much-needed supplies and donations – including water, food, medicine and diapers – to the hospital. Several European nations denounced the attacks with France calling it “barbaric” while the United Kingdom’s new prime minister Keir Starmer said attacking innocent children was “the most depraved of actions.” The French foreign ministry said in a statement that the strikes were “barbaric acts, aimed directly and deliberately at a children’s hospital, should be added to the list of war crimes for which Russia will be held to account.” According to the World Health Organization, there have been more than 1,600 instances of heavy weapons attacks impacting medical facilities in Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion, with 141 people killed in these attacks. Last December, 12 pregnant women and four newborn babies had a lucky escape from a maternity hospital in Dnipro that had been extensively damaged in an airstrike. Previously, the bombing of a maternity and children’s hospital in Mariupol less than a month after Russian troops flooded across the border sparked international condemnation.

USA,CNN,Kayla Tausche,Politics,,,2024-07-08,12:09,Biden tells Hill Democrats he is staying in the race,"President Joe Biden told congressional Democrats in a letter on Monday that he will continue his reelection bid despite mounting concerns about his mental fitness and the viability of his campaign, while also hitting back at party “elites” in an interview ahead of a critical week on Capitol Hill. “I want you to know that despite all the speculation in the press and elsewhere, I am firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump,” Biden wrote in the letter, obtained by CNN. Biden sought to put growing concerns about his viability to rest in the forcefully worded letter. “The question of how to move forward has been well-aired for over a week now. And it’s time for it to end. We have one job. And that is to beat Donald Trump. We have 42 days to the Democratic Convention and 119 days to the general election. Any weakening of resolve or lack of clarity about the task ahead only helps Trump and hurts us,” Biden concluded. “It is time to come together, move forward as a unified party, and defeat Donald Trump.” RELATED ARTICLE
Inside a despondent White House: Aides gripped by unease as Biden’s political future remains uncertain It’s a critical week for Biden’s political future as he seeks to tamp down intensifying fallout with the House and Senate back in session for the first time since the debate. More than a handful of top House Democrats told Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Sunday that Biden needs to step aside amid concerns about down-ballot Democratic races. Shortly after the letter was released, Biden called into MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” part of a strategy to do more “off-the-cuff,” unscripted engagements to quell concerns about his age. But the appearance, while energetic, may not have had its intended impact. Biden offered a lengthy and occasionally off-topic response to a question about his letter to Hill Democrats calling for unity and lambasted Trump for being on the golf course after the debate. Trump has largely stayed under the radar while Biden battles the news cycle. “Well look — Democrats — Joe, let me say it this way, the reason I’ve been on the road so much, all over the country, while Trump is riding around in a golf cart, filling out his golf cart before, golf cart before he even hits the ball — but anyway, he hasn’t been anywhere in 10 days, I’ve been all over the country, No. 1,” he said. He continued: “And I’ve gone over the country for several reasons, one, to make sure my instinct was right about the party still wanting me to be the nominee. And all the data, all the data shows that the average Democrat out there who voted, 14 million of them who’ve voted for me, still want me to be the nominee, No. 1.” And in a pointed rebuke to his critics, Biden said, “I’m getting so frustrated by the elites. Now, I’m not talking about you guys, but by the elites in the party. They know so much more. But if any of these guys don’t think I should run, run against me. Go ahead. Announce — announce for president. Challenge me at the convention.” The president will continue his outreach to Democratic lawmakers this week, a campaign official tells CNN. Tuesday will be a consequential day as members are set hold a planned caucus meeting with Jeffries, and one member told CNN they anticipate that is the day when the dam will break. Congress returns to Washington on Tuesday for the first time since the June 27 debate on CNN that prompted widespread concern over Biden’s ability to secure a victory for Democrats in November and to serve an additional four years in office. In the week following his disastrous debate performance, Biden personally reached out to roughly 20 House Democrats, a campaign official tells CNN, and has spoken with party leaders — including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and Reps. Nancy Pelosi and James Clyburn — with a goal of reassuring them that the concerns within the party are being heard. Since then, Schumer and Clyburn have voiced support for Biden, while Jeffries has remained mum. Pelosi has said the questions surrounding Biden’s disastrous performance at the presidential debate were “legitimate.” Asked about Pelosi’s comments, Biden told ABC News, “it was a bad episode. No indication of any serious condition. I was exhausted.” On a call with senior House Democrats convened Sunday by Jeffries, a half-dozen lawmakers voiced their own concerns during a conversation one aide described to CNN as “pretty brutal.” Those lawmakers — which CNN has reported to include Reps. Jerry Nadler, Adam Smith, Mark Takano and Joe Morelle — represent the highest-ranking Democrats on the Judiciary, Armed Services, Veterans Affairs and House Administration committees. RELATED ARTICLE
Biden’s fate is on the line in the most critical days of his 50-year political career A campaign official declined to say whether the president had spoken directly with Sen. Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat who organized a concurrent effort among like-minded senators to explore the possibility of an official request for Biden to step aside. Warner canceled a follow-up meeting scheduled for Monday evening, a source tells CNN, after news of the group’s efforts leaked. The next meeting will be Tuesday with Senate Democrats and their leadership. Biden told ABC News that Warner was a “good man” but has a “different perspective.” Biden’s campaign on Monday highlighted a list of supportive statements from Hill Democrats, seeking to amplify the voices who have expressed confidence in the president’s candidacy in recent days. Also on Monday, the Biden campaign is hosting a donor call with its national finance committee, a source familiar with the call said, another sign of outreach. A senior Democratic adviser told CNN that Biden is expected to join the call, underscoring a top concern of the campaign about whether donors will continue to back him or redirect their money to House and Senate campaign efforts if he stays in the race. Campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon will lead the call, and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore is expected to be among the speakers joining, the source said. The call is expected to take place around 12 p.m. ET, and it’s unclear how many donors will join. The campaign held a similar call last week where O’Malley Dillon defended the president’s health and said the team was “clear-eyed, not pollyanish” about the president’s debate performance. About 500 donors joined that call. Moore was among the governors who met with Biden at the White House last week, telling reporters after the meeting he supports the president but acknowledged the concerns from voters. “We always believe that when you love someone, you tell them the truth. And I think we came in and we were honest about the feedback that we were getting. We were honest about the concerns that we are hearing from people,” Moore said. He continued, “And we’re also honest about the fact that as the president continued to tell us and show us that he was all in, that we said that we would stand with him.” CNN’s Jeff Zeleny contributed to this report.",31,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/08/politics/joe-biden-house-democrats/index.html
USA,CNN,Lisa Respers France,Entertainment,,,2024-07-08,09:33,Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce: A timeline honoring the one year anniversary of him tackling her heart,"Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift’s love affair is “so high school” in the best way. Not only have they given fans and followers something to be dreamy about, but there’s also the anticipation of whether Kelce will put a ring on it (and not one of his Super Bowl championship ones). Here’s a look back at the alchemy that got us to this era: Kelce is very familiar with Kansas City’s Arrowhead Stadium since that’s where his team, the Kansas City Chiefs, play. But on July 8, 2023, he was there for a different reason – to see Swift perform as part of her “Eras Tour.” A few weeks later he shared the story on his podcast “New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce,” which he co-hosts with his brother, about how he had attempted to get Swift his phone number via a Swiftie-style friendship bracelet. “I was disappointed that she doesn’t talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings,” he told the world after his brother Jason asked about attending the concert. “So I was a little butthurt I didn’t get to hand her one of the bracelets I made for her.” “If you’re up on Taylor Swift concerts, there are friendship bracelets, and I received a bunch of them being there, but I wanted to give Taylor Swift one with my number on it,” Kelce said. When Jason asked if his brother meant his jersey number or his phone number, the Kansas City tight end quipped, “You know which one.” From there, Kelce found himself fielding questions about what, if anything, was going on between him and Swift. “I’m not gonna talk about my personal life,” he said during an interview with NFL+ host Andrew Siciliano. That didn’t stop the speculation that the pair were dating, and Kelce shared during an appearance on “The Pat McAfee Show” that he had invited Swift to watch him play. “I threw the ball in her court,” the football player said. “I told her, ‘I’ve seen you rock the stage in Arrowhead, you might have to come see me rock the stage in Arrowhead.’ We’ll see what happens in the near future.” Swift eventually took him up on it and appeared at his game on September 24, sitting next to his mother, Donna Kelce, in the family suite. Swifties, as her hardcore fan base is known, promptly lost it, heralding the kickoff of mania over the pair. The NFL began leaning in to “Traylor,” “Tayvis,” “Swelce” or whatever you choose to use as their couple nickname. The league’s official X account posted about her plenty when on October 1 Swift and some of her famous friends including Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds cheered Kelce and his team on against the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium. Everyone felt swept up in the excitement over the two, and Donna Kelce told CNN that all the attention surrounding her son and Swift felt “unreal.” “I tell everyone that it’s kind of like an alternate universe that I just happened to be in,” Donna Kelce said. “Like, I went through a third wall into another dimension. That’s what it feels like.” And in a case of “we can show you better than we can tell you,” Kelce and Swift appeared to confirm their coupledom when they were photographed holding hands in New York City after they both made separate surprise appearances on “Saturday Night Live’s” season 49 premiere on October 14. Swift gave definite girlfriend vibes a week later when she and Brittany Mahomes, the wife of Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes, showed off their special handshake during a successful Chiefs play against the Los Angeles Chargers. Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes are besties as well as teammates. There was no doubt that Swift and Kelce were indeed a couple once he traveled to Buenos Aires, Argentina, for her November 11 “Eras Tour” stop. Not only was Kelce there with Swift’s dad, she swapped the “Karma” lyric “Karma is the guy in the screen coming straight home to me” – which many thought was about her ex-boyfriend actor Joe Alwyn – for “Karma is the guy on the Chiefs coming straight home to me.” And if that wasn’t swoon-worthy enough, video of her running off stage into Kelce’s arms for a smooch had those rooting for the superstar singer to find her person singing “It’s a love story, baby, just say ‘Yes.’” Later that month Kelce was the cover star of WSJ Magazine’s and opened up about their relationship. “Obviously I’ve never dated anyone with that kind of aura about them…. I’ve never dealt with it,” Kelce told the publication of Swift’s life in the spotlight. “But at the same time, I’m not running away from any of it…. The scrutiny she gets, how much she has a magnifying glass on her, every single day, paparazzi outside her house, outside every restaurant she goes to, after every flight she gets off, and she’s just living, enjoying life. When she acts like that I better not be the one acting all strange.” Kelce wasn’t the only one willing to talk about their relationship. Swift was named Time magazine’s 2023 “Person of the Year” and in an interview with the publication, she cleared up speculation that they became official at that first September football game she attended. “By the time I went to that first game, we were a couple,” she told Time. She added, they “would never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date” in the public sphere like that. Makes sense. Not only did Kelce and Swift ring in the new year together with a sweet kiss, but she also met his brother Jason for the first time. The then-Philadelphia Eagles center and his wife Kylie Kelce hung out with Swift during the Chiefs’ playoff game against the Buffalo Bills, Suffice it to say, Jason Kelce made quite the impression as he stripped off his shirt, guzzled beer and hopped out of the suite window to have some fun with the fans. Afterwards the brothers talked about it during an episode of their podcast and Jason Kelce said his wife had warned him to be on his “best behavior” for his first meet up with his beloved brother’s girlfriend. “I was like, ‘Kylie, the first day I met you I was blackout drunk and fell asleep at the bar,” he said during the podcast. “This is part of the charm. This is part of the Jason Kelce charm. I wanna make my best first impression.’” It apparently worked as Travis Kelce told him, “Tay said she absolutely loved you.” Love was in the air the month of Valentine’s Day – not just between Swift and her boyfriend, but for his sports fans. His team made it once again to the Super Bowl, which allowed the NFL to further cash in given that Swift had been boosting ratings with her attendance at the games. And while some thought the league was overdoing it with all the shots of the singer during the games, Mama Kelce was excited for the new audience Swift was attracting. “I think it’s amazing that more and more people are embracing the NFL. I love sports. I especially love football because my boys have been doing it for so long,” Donna Kelce told CNN at the time. “I truly believe that it’s bringing families closer. Sports tends to do that.” “I’ve gotten letters, texts and comments when I’m in the airport about how fathers are so happy that their daughters are finally coming to them to try to understand the game,” she added. “And they couldn’t have thought that would have ever happened before now.” Her son Travis and his Chiefs went on to win the Super Bowl, their third in five years and their second in a row. And because we must know how did it end, Swift and Kelce gave us that movie moment when he turned from celebrating with his mother, told Swift “Come here girl,” and the pair embraced and exchanged a few kisses on the field. There was much partying and Swift even joked in a TikTok video about ending up in a nightclub with her parents as they celebrated the historic win. Later that month Kelce thrilled concertgoers in Australia when he flew out to join her when she played her Sydney tour stop. Good luck remembering who played Coachella because all eyes were on Swift and her man as they enjoyed the annual music festival. It was so serious that a video of a lip reader trying to interpret what the couple said to each other while they jammed went viral. But that was nothing compared to the excitement when Swift dropped her new album “The Tortured Poets Department” on April 19. Immediately, Swifties were trying to decode which songs/lyrics might be about Kelce. The singer scored with all the sports references in her track “The Alchemy,” which led many to believe that the song about having an intense attraction to a new lover was inspired by Kelce. “So when I touch down/Call the amateurs and/Cut ‘em from the team/Ditch the clowns, get the crown/Baby I’m the one to beat,” Swift sings. “Cause the sign on your heart/Said it’s still reserved for me/Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?” Kelce proved to be Swift’s number one fan and revealed his favorite Swift ‘era.’ “I’m a big ‘1989’ fan,” Kelce told “Access Hollywood” during his second annual Kelce Jam music festival. “But I’m not going to lie, I may be a little biased towards ‘The Tortured Poets Department.’ Just a little bit.” The pair also enjoyed a romantic vacation in Lake Como, Italy, while Swift was on break from the European leg of her Eras Tour. Speaking of Europe, Swift posted a selfie of her, Kelce, Prince William and his two oldest kids, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, from her London concert, which also counted as his first Instagram-official shot on her feed. Kelce wasn’t just along for the ride, it turns out. He made his debut at her Wembley Stadium concert in London where he donned a top hat and tails for a cameo on stage with Swift. Swift posted about her performance at the stadium, writing, “And I’m still cracking up/swooning over @killatrav’s Eras Tour debut.” Kelce gave us the behind the scenes of his surprise debut, sharing on his podcast that “It was an absolute blast.” “It was such a fun, playful part of the show and it was like the perfect time for me to go up there, just be a ham and have some fun, not only with [Swift]… but the crowd and really try and get everybody excited for the rest of the show,” he said. “It was awesome.” His main focus? Not to fumble. “The golden rule was ‘Do not drop Taylor. Get her to the couch safe,’” he said. “Do not drop the baby” is what he thought, and as usual, Kelce won.",61,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/08/entertainment/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-anniversary/index.html
USA,CNN,Matt Egan,Business,,,2024-07-08,12:22,Columbia removes three deans from power for ‘very troubling’ antisemitic text messages,"Columbia University announced Monday it has permanently removed three deans from their posts after finding they engaged in “very troubling” text messages that touched on antisemitic tropes. In a letter, Columbia President Minouche Shafik committed to holding those officials responsible for the “disturbing” incident, which occurred during a May 31 panel discussion about Jewish life at an alumni event. “The incident revealed behavior and sentiments that were not only unprofessional, but also, disturbingly touched on ancient antisemitic tropes,” Shafik said in the Monday statement.
“Whether intended as such or not, these sentiments are unacceptable and deeply upsetting, conveying a lack of seriousness about the concerns and the experiences of members of our Jewish community that is antithetical to our University’s values and the standards we must uphold in our community.” Columbia leaders have been under fire for months to show they are taking action to combat antisemitism on campus and protect Jewish students and staff. Angela Olinto, Columbia’s provost, said she shares Shafik’s “dismay” and announced the three staff members involved “have been permanently removed from their positions” and will “remain on leave at this time.” “Their conduct was wrong and contrary to the mission and values of our institution,” Olinto said. “It revealed, at best, an ignorance of the history of antisemitism.” A Columbia spokesperson told CNN that all three officials are still employed by the university. CNN reached out to the three officials for comment. However, Columbia signaled that a fourth official involved in the text messages, Josef Sorett, the dean of Columbia College, is staying in power after apologizing and taking responsibility. On Monday Sorett sent a message to Columbia College students apologizing for his actions. “I am deeply sorry that this happened in a community that I lead and , (sic) that I was part of any of the exchanges, and I pledge to spearhead the change we need to ensure this never happens again,” the message, which was also posted online, read. Last week, Rep. Virginia Foxx, the Republican chairwoman of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, demanded Columbia hold the three officials accountable and revealed images of the group text exchange. “Jewish students deserve better than to have harassment and threats against them dismissed as ‘privilege,’ and Jewish faculty members deserve better than to be mocked by their colleagues,” Foxx said in the statement last week.",13,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/08/business/columbia-deans-antisemitic-tropes/index.html?utm_source=business_ribbon
USA,CNN,Jeanne Sahadi,Business,,,2024-07-08,11:46,Early signs of dementia can show in your finances,"Financial files in disarray. Late payments and last-warning service-cutoff notices. Multiple daily bank withdrawals. Out-of-character purchases. When a family member who has been fairly responsible with money all their lives becomes careless with their finances, it may be one sign of as-yet-undiagnosed dementia. Researchers at the New York Federal Reserve who analyzed both US credit reporting and Medicare data found that in the five years before a dementia diagnosis, a person’s average credit scores may start to weaken and their payment delinquencies rise. “The harmful financial effects of undiagnosed memory disorders exacerbate the already substantial financial pressure households face upon diagnosis,” the researchers wrote. “Beyond susceptibility to payment delinquency, early stage [Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders] may affect new account openings and debt accumulation, credit utilization, and/or credit mix.” Their findings echo the results of a 2020 study from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Marcey Tidwell, who lives in Bloomington, Indiana, said those findings are “not remotely shocking.” Tidwell’s mother was diagnosed with a form of dementia in 2020 and has been living with her daughter ever since.

Class action suit alleges Raytheon discriminates against older job seekers Tidwell said that for most of her life, her mother was an “outrageously methodical human being” who kept the bills paid and the family records organized across many moves as her husband pursued a career in the military. After going through her mother’s papers this year, Tidwell surmises that her mother’s memory started faltering around 2015, because from that point forward her record-keeping became “less than pristine.” For example, Tidwell said, her mom used to keep an immaculate record of checks written and deposits and withdrawals made in her checkbook register. But that register became a mess. “There was a bunch of stuff scratched out and she was obsessively adding and re-adding — she knew things weren’t all they could be. Later on, I saw that she took out large amounts of her savings, more than she needed for groceries.” Karen Lemay, who lives in Ottawa, Canada, knew something was really wrong with her father in 2022 when she saw on his desk piles of late-payment notices and final-notification warnings from service providers and insurers.

You’ve retired. Can you get a mortgage — and should you? Her father was a former finance executive who “was very conservative with his money, very smart about it and never reckless with it,” she said. And he had strongly impressed upon his daughter the importance of paying off her credit card in full every month to avoid interest. Yet Lemay discovered he owed $50,000 in charges, interest and late payment fees on a Visa card. He also financed the purchase of a new car he didn’t need, just months before police took away his driver’s license. Normally, he would only buy high-end used cars with cash, she said. What’s more, his daughter noted, he failed to pay his 2021 taxes. So he ended up owing the government roughly $20,000, the bulk of which was for late payment and underpayment penalties. “I spoke to him about some of his balances and he refused to believe he hadn’t paid them,” Lemay said. Jayne Sibley, who lives in the United Kingdom, knows the pain and stress of dealing with the financial behaviors that can signal dementia. Her father and mother were both diagnosed with different forms of it. Her father moved into a nursing home years ago, but her now-deceased mother remained in her own home, albeit with live-in care. “The most challenging thing we faced was managing mum’s everyday money as her condition progressed. She would overspend on things she didn’t need or want. Random items, cleaning equipment, luxury food. She also fell victim to scams over the phone — a fake insurance policy, those sorts of things,” Sibley said. Her mother also would take money out of the cash machine two to three times a day and give it to anyone who asked. Acutely aware of how high long-term care costs were, given her father’s situation, Sibley said she worried that her mother would run through the money that would be needed for her own care. While her mother’s condition made her vulnerable with money, she initially was still able to walk and shop and go to yoga on her own. In other words, she was able to maintain a lot of her autonomy and social ties. To try to stem the money outflow, Sibley and her brother tried doling out a week’s worth of cash for their mother “but she’d spend it all in one go,” she said. Ditto when they tried divvying the cash up into daily envelopes. Eventually, they took away her cash card. But, soon after, her condition worsened, Sibley said. “She wasn’t able to maintain her familiar routines and social connections. That’s when we realized there has to be a better way.” With her husband, she founded Sibstar, which offers a debit card in the UK that can be used by a person with dementia to maintain some sense of financial autonomy and social engagement. When needed, family caregivers can monitor their debit transactions via an app. As a person’s condition worsens, the caregiver can set limits on how much money can be spent on any given day or week, and where the card can be used (eg, at cash machines, online or at the grocery store). While there are few dementia-specific financial tools to reduce the odds that someone squanders their own hard-earned money, there are steps you can take to make it easier to assume control over another person’s finances when they become incapacitated. In 2008, a year after her father died without a will and a dozen years before her mother was diagnosed with dementia, Tidwell said she and her siblings took their mother to a lawyer to make sure she had a will, named her medical proxy and named the person to whom she would give power of attorney to handle her financial affairs should the need arise. That made it easier for Tidwell, among other things, to get online access in 2018 to her mother’s bank account to make sure nothing was amiss. By 2020, she had automated her mother’s bill paying online. “The time to make plans is before you need to. It’s hard to overstate what a gift that trip to the lawyer in 2008 was to ‘future me,’” said Tidwell, who fully manages her mother’s finances now that her condition has worsened considerably. Since dementia can worsen over time and because someone in the initial stages may not recognize they are more vulnerable to financial errors and scams, the US National Institute on Aging recommends that a family take steps early on to alleviate those concerns, such as setting up automated bill payments for the person with dementia. Of course, no amount of advanced financial planning can alleviate the heartbreak of watching a loved one with dementia decline. “I prepared as best as I could, but it’s still hard,” Tidwell said. That’s why she advises anyone potentially facing a similar situation to, in her words, “make the easy part easy.”",31,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/08/success/money-problems-dementia/index.html?utm_source=business_ribbon

After an impressive 6-2 6-1 win, an emotional Svitolina struggled to get through her on-court interview after the match. The 29-year-old received a rousing round of applause from the crowd on Court 2 as she tried to compose herself. “It was a good performance from my side today and it’s a very difficult day today for Ukrainian people,” Svitolina said while fightback back tears. “So it was not easy to focus on the match today and since the morning it’s very difficult to read the news and just to go onto the court is extremely tough, so I’m happy that I could play today and get a win. “Thank you for the support.” RELATED ARTICLE
After beating Coco Gauff at Wimbledon, Emma Navarro could be the next US tennis star Svitolina, the No. 21 seed at Wimbledon, was utterly dominant in her win over Wang and needed just 55 minutes to book her place in the Wimbledon quarterfinals. A semifinalist at Wimbledon last year, Svitolina hit 21 winners - including eight aces - and made just 10 unforced errors against her Chinese opponent, ranked 42nd in the world. A ruthless Svitolina converted four of her six break point chances and she will now face 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina on Wednesday for a place in the semifinals. Rybakina, the No. 4 seed, was involved a hard-fought contest earlier on Wednesday until opponent Anna Kalinskaya had to retire in the second set due to a wrist injury. At least 36 people were killed across Ukraine in Russian attacks on Monday, Ukrainian authorities said. Kyiv’s Okhmatdyt hospital has been crucial in supporting some the sickest children from across the country. Two adults were killed and 16 others – including seven children – were injured in the attack, according to Kyiv’s mayor Vitaliy Klytchko Some 137 people were wounded in the attacks which left nearly 100 buildings damaged.

USA,CNN,Leah Dolan,Paris Olympics 2024,2024-07-08,09:45,,,Fun or frightening? A brief history of Olympic mascot design,"For more than fifty years, athletes competing in the Olympic Games have often been cheered on by either a furry, feathered or slimy friend. The Olympic mascot – a cartoonish encapsulation of the host city’s culture and history – is so important, designs are often selected and finalized years before the Games take place. According to the International Olympic Committee, the role of these quirky caricatures is to help spread a “festive atmosphere” and embody the exuberant spirit of the event. Over the decades, the world has welcomed snowmen, sasquatches, cowboy-hat-wearing bears and aliens to the Olympic stage. This year, the mascot will take the form of a hat — specifically the distinctive red Phrygian cap worn by emancipated Roman slaves which became a symbol of freedom during the French Revolution. The first mascot was created in 1968 by designer Aline Lafargue for the Grenoble Winter Games in France. Affectionately named “Shuss,” the character consists of a two-toned head and lightning-bolt shaped leg attached to skis. Despite holding the esteemed title of first ever mascot, Lafargue created and submitted her design for Shuss in just one night. To find a worthy representative, each host country will typically organize a submission call-out or contest. In 2014, a competition held by Russia in anticipation for the Sochi Winter Games received more than 24,000 drawings. The winners, a trio of arctic mammals intended to represent the three spots on the Olympic podium, were selected by a public vote with the results broadcast on Russian TV. But this hasn’t always been the case: for the 1984 Los Angeles Summer Olympics, one of the first Olympic events to be heavily subsidized by corporate financing, Disney won the private bid for mascot design. Since these creatures are also pivotal to official merchandise, cute and cuddly have long been key metrics for any mascot’s success. Merchandise of Beijing’s rotund panda mascot Bing Dwen Dwen for the 2022 Winter Games sold “like hotcakes,” while Disney’s bald eagle, Sam, was meticulously constructed to appear short, stubby and soft as opposed to realistic, pointed and ominous in order to appeal to children. And when illustrators have deviated, viewers have let them know. Ten years ago, Iris design agency produced two silver cyclops extra-terrestrials to usher in the London Games. “If these things had been in a ’50’s horror movie it would now be considered a classic,” wrote one CNN reader in 2012. One mascot, the bear Misha, even went extra-terrestrial in 1978 when it went to space on the “Soyuz” rocket two years before the 1980 Moscow Games. Character design becomes especially important when the Games coincide with a unique moment in history. For example Sydney, Australia, the host country of the first Olympics of the millennium, commissioned three mascots for the first time in the Games’ history. The three anime-style cartoons, Syd, Olly and Millie, were named in reference to Sydney, Olympics and Millennium – and t-shirts from this landmark Games are still circulating second-hand resale sites now.",8,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/08/style/olympic-mascot-design-history/index.html
SouthKorea,Yonhap News Agency,Yumi Lee,politics,2024-07-08,23:50,,,"The original text of five text messages from Mrs. Kim revealed... “It’s all my fault. If you decide, I’ll follow you.”","Sent at 23:50 on 2024-07-08 (Incheon = Yonhap News) Reporter Hong Hae-in = President Yoon Seok-yeol and People Power Party presidential candidate Han Dong-hoon applaud the commemorative speech by Korea Freedom Federation President Kang Seok-ho at the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Korea Freedom Federation held at Incheon Namdong Gymnasium on the 4th. 2024.7.4 hihong@yna.co.kr (Seoul = Yonhap News) Reporters Lee Yu-mi and Ahn Chae-won = The original texts of five text messages sent by Ms. Kim Kun-hee to then-emergency response committee chairman and party candidate Han Dong-hoon during the conflict between the ruling and opposition parties over allegations of accepting luxury bags in January were made public through a media report on the 8th. TV Chosun reported the full text of the five text messages that Ms. Kim sent to candidate Han between January 15th and 25th. According to the report, in her first text message on January 15, Mrs. Kim said to Candidate Han, “I think you were uncomfortable with the issue of the President and my special prosecutor, so I will apologize on your behalf,” and added, “I am upset because you have been used politically for so long, so I ask for your generous understanding.” January 15 was ten days after President Yoon Seok-yeol vetoed the “Kim Gun-hee Special Prosecutor Act” that the opposition party had forced through. The part where Mrs. Kim said, “I think you were uncomfortable with the issue of the President and my special prosecutor,” suggests that there was conflict between President Yoon and Candidate Han over the “Kim Gun-hee Special Prosecutor Act.” Mrs. Kim then suggested, “I will apologize a hundred times. How about talking to V (President Yoon) or meeting him just once?” In her second text message that day, Mrs. Kim also said, “It is all my fault,” and added, “I think I am being treated like this because I am not fit for this position and am not qualified to do so. I am sorry.” Later, on January 18, a candidate stated his position regarding the suspicion that Ms. Kim had accepted a luxury bag, saying, ""I think there were some areas where the public could be concerned."" This was interpreted as a reference to Ms. Kim's responsibility. Prior to this, on the 17th, then-Vice Presidential Committee member Kim Kyung-yool compared Ms. Kim to Marie Antoinette, the queen during the French Revolution. In her third text message on January 19, Ms. Kim stated, ""I sincerely apologize that things have gotten worse because of my negligence. If my apology could resolve the issue, I would like to apologize a thousand, ten thousand times."" She continued, ""However, it is not easy to make a decision because of the possibility that the issue will grow further, with the controversy over sincerity and the issue of responsibility also igniting. Nevertheless, if you decide at the level of the VICE Presidential Committee that it is right to apologize, I will follow your wishes."" In her fourth text message on January 23, two days after Candidate Han received a request for resignation from the Office of the President, Mrs. Kim said, “I heard a few days ago that I was using the comment team to slander the chairman and those around me. I was so shocked and devastated.” She then called Candidate Han a “comrade,” and wrote, “We have been on a life-or-death journey together, and I am ashamed that I even suspected that I could attack the other person just because we had a little bit of a mismatch.” She added, “I was so heartbroken by Accountant Kim Kyung-yool’s extreme wording, but I decided to understand after hearing the chairman’s words about diverse opinions.” Mrs. Kim reiterated, “This is an incident where I was very wrong. I just hope that I do not harm the hard work of those who have walked the path of suffering because of me,” and “If the chairman decides that an ‘apology’ is necessary despite all this, I will make a firm decision.” In her last text message on January 25, Mrs. Kim wrote, “I think the president must have been hurt by his loud outbursts in the past,” and “I fully understand how upset he must have been to hear such disappointing words after having worked so hard to take on the role of the emergency committee.” She continued, “It was all my fault, so I have nothing to say to you,” and added, “I hope the two of you can resolve this misunderstanding over a meal soon. I am truly sorry.” Candidate Han did not respond to Mrs. Kim’s five text messages. The reason is that he viewed private communication as inappropriate in a situation where discussions between the ruling and opposition parties were taking place through public channels. As the original texts of Mrs. Kim’s text messages have been made public, the battle between candidate Han and the rival candidates for party leadership, as well as the pro-Yoon (pro-Yoon Seok-yeol) and pro-Han (pro-Han Dong-hoon) factions, is expected to intensify. Pro-Yoon figures are claiming that candidate Han is distorting the content of Mrs. Kim's text message, which clearly expressed her 'intention to apologize', and candidate Han's side is emphasizing again that it means that she will not apologize, and is putting forward the frame of the presidential office's 'intervention in party affairs'. yumi@yna.co.kr Report to KakaoTalk okjebo

Since the onset of China's main flood season, heavy and prolonged rainfall has resulted in flooding and geological disasters in various regions, notably causing a breach in the dike of Dongting Lake, China's second-largest freshwater lake, in Hunan Province.

China,People.cn,"Hongyu, Liang Jun",Society,2024-07-08,14:29,,,Over 70 pct of Chinese youth find their hometowns increasingly attractive,"A recent survey of 1,500 young Chinese people showed that 70.4 percent of the respondents see their home regions as highly attractive places for personal development.
Respondents from the northeastern and western regions of China prefer their home regions to other parts of the country primarily because of relatively low living costs, including costs of housing and commodities, according to the survey, which was jointly conducted by the social survey center of China Youth Daily and questionnaire website wenjuan.com.
After working outside her hometown to gain experience in running a business, Liu Yunyang (pseudonym), a post-95s woman from northeast China, returned to Dalian, northeast China's Liaoning Province, and opened a restaurant in the city this year.
She has a deep attachment to the northeast region of China, and enjoys a close affinity with the city where she lived for many years, Liu said.
""If there are good job opportunities, I'd prefer to return home for my career,"" said Feng Jing (pseudonym), a junior at Beijing Jiaotong University.
Hailing from Lanzhou, northwest China's Gansu Province, Feng Jing appreciates the charm of metropolises like Beijing, but still prefers her hometown, as it offers a more relaxed living environment where she can enjoy a less stressful life, she said.
""Everyone hopes their hometowns will develop better,"" Feng said. She believes that more young people would choose to work in their hometowns if their home regions further sharpen their industrial advantages and foster a youth-friendly employment environment.
Jiang Yao, a post-00s graduate who majored in Vietnamese at Guangxi Minzu University in Nanning, south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, said she will probably pursue a career in her home city, southwest China's Chongqing Municipality.
""First of all, that's where my family are. Besides, Chongqing has well-developed infrastructure and convenient transportation, and the housing prices are also acceptable. So it is pretty attractive for me,"" Jiang explained.
The survey found that the central region of China is becoming increasingly appealing to young talents due to advantages such as the rapid development of emerging industries, rich scientific and educational resources, as well as strong capacity for research and innovation.
Ye Yanlei, who graduated with a Ph.D. from Tsinghua University last year, chose to develop his career in the central Chinese city of Wuhu, Anhui Province.
""In recent years, the central region has been continuously intensifying its efforts to boost technological innovation and industrial upgrading,"" Ye said, noting that Wuhu boasts featured industries, a relatively complete industrial system, as well as a good number of leading enterprises.
As more favorable policies target the central region, it will become increasingly attractive in the future, offering young people opportunities to apply their knowledge and achieve personal development, Ye said.
Jia Zhilong, deputy director of the Anhui Quantum Computing Engineering Research Center's Quantum Computing Chip Provincial Key Laboratory, has lived in the central Chinese city of Hefei in Anhui Province for nearly 10 years, gaining deep insights into the city's industrial development and urban construction.

In his view, Hefei's strength in scientific research ranks among the top in the country, especially in the quantum industry, where it leads the nation.
Moreover, Hefei's convenient transportation provides an important foundation for industrial development, allowing various production factors to flow efficiently and facilitating close communication between universities and companies along industrial chains, according to Jia.
""Provinces in central China have great location advantages, allowing for in-depth alignment with the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area,"" Jia pointed out.
The rich scientific and educational resources, comprehensive manufacturing industry chains, well-developed infrastructure, coupled with relatively low living costs, are all important factors attracting young people to develop their careers in the central region, he added.
Of the young people who took part in the survey, 52.7 percent were male and 47.3 percent were female.
The post-00s, post-95s, post-90s, and post-85s generation respondents made up 19.4 percent, 32.5 percent, 33.8 percent, and 14.3 percent of the survey, respectively.
In terms of the survey participants’ hometown regions, 32.5 percent were from the eastern region, 26.6 percent from the northeast, 31.7 percent from the central region, and 9.2 percent from the western region.

China,People.cn,"Zhang Kaiwei, Liang Jun",World,2024-07-08,17:00,,,Boeing to plead guilty to avoid criminal trial over 737 Max crashes,"WASHINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Boeing will plead guilty to a criminal fraud charge related to the two crashes of its 737 Max jetliners, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) said on Sunday.
Under the deal, the U.S. planemaker has agreed to pay a fine of 243.6 million U.S. dollars to resolve the DOJ's investigation into two 737 MAX fatal crashes that killed 346 people. The decision follows the government's determination that Boeing violated an agreement shielding it from prosecution for over three years.
Prosecutors accused the planemaker of deceiving regulators who approved the airplane and its pilot-training requirements. Last week, they gave Boeing the choice of either entering a guilty plea and paying a fine as part of its sentence or facing a trial on the felony charge of conspiracy to defraud the United States.
As part of the deal, Boeing also agreed to spend at least 455 million U.S. dollars over the next three years to boost safety and compliance programs.
The DOJ said in a court filing that it and Boeing are working to document the full written plea agreement and file it in federal court in Texas by July 19.

China,People.cn,"Hongyu, Liang Jun",Culture,2024-07-08,14:52,,,Inheritor passes on tin carving techniques in China's Jiangxi,"Liu Jianqiang is a representative inheritor of the national-level intangible cultural heritage of tin carving techniques in Lianhua county, east China's Jiangxi Province.
The craft dates back at least 600 years in the county, according to calculations based on the pedigree of a local family and local historical records.
The inheritor started to learn the craft from his father when he was about 11 years old.
Making a large tin carving work involves over 10 steps, each of which has strict operational requirements, according to Liu.
""Tin carving requires great patience,"" Liu said, adding that it takes a few days to over 10 days to finish a tin carving work. The most challenging parts are hammering the patterns and carving the designs and characters, he noted.
""In the past, tin carving was passed down only within families. But now, I'm willing to teach anyone who wants to learn. I hope more young people will join us to better preserve and pass on the craft,"" Liu said.
